Educational stakeholder feedback was another significant component, with numerous studies collecting data from teachers and special education professionals (Costa et al., 2013; Hamzah et al., 2014; Lemaignan et al., 2022). These educators provided crucial perspectives on the educational appropriateness and effectiveness of the interventions within classroom settings. Some studies employed a comprehensive multi-stakeholder approach, gathering feedback from multiple sources including parents, clinicians, and educators simultaneously (Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Charron et al., 2017; De Korte et al., 2020).

The feedback collection methods varied across studies, including structured interviews (Sandygulova et al., 2019), satisfaction questionnaires (Papadopoulou et al., 2022), observational assessments (Shimaya et al., 2016), and standardized evaluation forms. This diverse approach to stakeholder feedback collection helped provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interventions' effectiveness and impact across different contexts and perspectives.

 There were 31 papers that reported using standardized assessment tools in their studies, while 65 papers did not employ such tools. The standardized assessment tools utilized across these studies can be categorized into several primary domains: autism-specific assessments, social-emotional evaluations, developmental scales, and learning assessments.

In the domain of autism-specific assessments, multiple studies employed well-established tools such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS/CARS2) (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Giannopulu, 2013; Marathaki et al., 2022), the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (Bharatharaj et al., 2017, 2016, 2018), and the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS-2) (Che Hamid et al., 2013; Miskam et al., 2013; Taheri et al., 2016, 2018, 2019). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) was also utilized in several studies (Boccanfuso et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2019; Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020).

For social-emotional assessment, researchers employed various standardized tools including the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (De Korte et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2023), the Test of Emotional Comprehension (TEC), and the Emotional Lexicon Test (ELT) (Marino et al., 2020; Tartarisco et al., 2022). The Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS) was specifically used to evaluate joint attention skills (Carlson et al., 2018; Kajopoulos et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2018).

Developmental and learning assessments included the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Boccanfuso et al., 2016), the Battelle Developmental Inventory (Cervera et al., n.d.), and the VB-MAPP assessment tool (Conti et al., 2020). Some studies incorporated specialized assessments for specific skills, such as the NEPSY-II visuo-motor precision subtest (Casellato et al., 2017) and Stambak's Rhythmic Structures Reproduction test (Taheri et al., 2016).

The implementation of these standardized assessment tools provided researchers with validated measures to evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions and ensure scientific rigor in their methodological approaches. This systematic use of standardized tools enables more reliable comparisons across studies and strengthens the evidence base for robot-assisted interventions in supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities.

 There were 87 papers that incorporated behavioral indicators in their methodology to measure and evaluate participant responses and interactions, while 9 papers did not include such measurements. The behavioral indicators used across these studies can be categorized into several main types:

Eye contact and gaze behavior was the most commonly measured indicator, with studies like Scassellati (2018), Alnajjar et al. (2021), and Lee et al. (2013) specifically developing systems to track and analyze participants' eye contact patterns and gaze direction. Many studies utilized specialized camera systems and eye-tracking technology to quantify these measurements.

Touch interaction and manipulation skills were also frequently assessed, as demonstrated in studies by Bharatharaj et al. (2017), Lee et al. (2014), and Giannopulu (2013). These studies analyzed how participants physically interacted with robots through touch patterns, applied forces, and manipulation of robot components.

Verbal output measurements were incorporated by numerous researchers, including Shah et al. (2023) who analyzed speech characteristics through metrics like Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) and Type-Token Ratio (TTR). Silvera-Tawil et al. (2018) and Shimaya et al. (2019) evaluated verbal communication patterns including utterance frequency and silence duration.

Task completion rates and accuracy were widely used as quantitative behavioral indicators. Studies like Subramani et al. (2017) measured specific skills like shape tracing accuracy, while others like Tartarisco et al. (2022) automatically recorded correct and incorrect responses to assigned tasks.

Imitation skills assessment was another common behavioral indicator, particularly in studies focused on motor skills and social learning. Bugnariu et al. (2013) measured joint angles and movement trajectories to assess imitation accuracy, while Marathaki et al. (2022) evaluated both basic and complex imitation abilities.

Posture analysis and body language were measured in studies like Rakhymbayeva & Sandygulova (2021), who analyzed body posture alongside facial expressions to assess engagement levels. Several studies incorporated multiple behavioral indicators simultaneously to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of participant responses and progress.

This extensive use of behavioral indicators across the literature demonstrates their importance in quantitatively measuring the effectiveness of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The variety of indicators used reflects the complex nature of social, cognitive, and motor skills being addressed in these interventions.

 There were 43 papers that reported using statistical analysis in their methodology, while 53 papers did not include statistical analysis in their results. This indicates that approximately 45% of the reviewed studies incorporated quantitative statistical methods to evaluate their findings.

The statistical methods employed varied considerably across studies, with several papers utilizing multiple analytical approaches. The most commonly used statistical tests included t-tests (both paired and independent samples), ANOVA, and non-parametric tests such as Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. For instance, Papadopoulou et al. (2022) employed both Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, while Hong et al. (2022) utilized linear mixed effect models and repeated measures ANOVA.

Several studies implemented more sophisticated statistical approaches, such as linear mixed-effects models (De Korte et al., 2020) and leave-one-out cross-validation (Kim et al., 2021). Some researchers also employed correlation analyses, with Giannopulu (2013) utilizing Spearman's correlation coefficient to analyze relationships between variables. Classification accuracy metrics were reported in studies focusing on machine learning applications, such as Wanglavan et al. (2019) and Welch et al. (2023), who used AUC and F1-scores.

The statistical analyses were primarily used to evaluate intervention effectiveness, compare pre-post intervention outcomes, analyze behavioral changes, and assess the reliability of technological implementations. For example, Boccanfuso et al. (2016) used correlations and linear mixed models to examine play patterns and affective responses, while Silva et al. (2023) employed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to evaluate improvements in social communication.

It is worth noting that the complexity and sophistication of statistical analyses varied significantly across studies, ranging from basic descriptive statistics to more complex multivariate analyses. This variation reflects the diverse nature of the research objectives and experimental designs within the field of robotics and artificial intelligence applications for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

 There were 73 papers that reported methodological limitations in their studies, while 23 papers did not report any limitations. The analysis of these limitations reveals several common methodological challenges in research involving robotics and individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The most frequently reported limitation was small sample size, which was mentioned in a substantial majority of the studies (e.g., Valadao et al., 2016; Alnajjar et al., 2021; Attawibulkul et al., 2019). Some studies had particularly small samples, with several including as few as 1-2 participants (Casellato et al., 2017; Chaldi & Mantzanidou, 2021; Kim et al., 2014). This limitation significantly impacts the statistical power and generalizability of findings.

Limited intervention duration and lack of long-term follow-up were also commonly cited limitations (Bharatharaj et al., 2016; Marathaki et al., 2022). For instance, some studies were conducted over very short periods, such as just 5 days (Bharatharaj et al., 2016), which may not be sufficient to observe meaningful behavioral changes or establish the sustainability of improvements.

The absence of control groups was another significant methodological limitation reported by several researchers (Charron et al., 2017; Conti et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2013). This absence makes it difficult to definitively attribute observed improvements to the robotic interventions rather than other factors.

Several studies also noted limitations regarding the generalizability of their findings (Brivio et al., 2021; De Korte et al., 2020), often due to participant characteristics or specific contextual factors. For example, some studies primarily included high-functioning participants (Chevalier et al., n.d.), limiting the applicability of findings to individuals with different levels of functioning.

The heterogeneity in assessment methods and intervention protocols was highlighted as a limitation in some studies (Zanatta et al., 2023), making it difficult to compare results across different research efforts. Additionally, some researchers noted challenges in accurately measuring social skills and potential assessment bias (Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020).

These methodological limitations highlight the need for larger, more rigorous studies with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods to better understand the effectiveness of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The reported technical challenges encompassed various aspects of both hardware and software implementations.

The most frequently reported technical limitations involved hardware-related issues. Several studies (Brivio et al., 2021; Marathaki et al., 2022; Sakka & Gaboriau, 2017) documented hardware failures that affected the implementation of their robotic systems. Speech recognition capabilities presented significant challenges, as noted in multiple studies (Papadopoulou et al., 2022; Pennington et al., 2014; Reardon et al., 2018), where the robots struggled to accurately interpret user inputs.

Software-related limitations were also prevalent. Studies reported issues with system integration and operational stability (Sandygulova et al., 2019; Subramani et al., 2017). For instance, Rakhymbayeva & Sandygulova (2021) encountered challenges with heterogeneous data formats and custom coding requirements. Some researchers (Shimaya et al., 2019) specifically noted delayed feedback systems as a technical constraint that impacted user interaction.

Sensor-related limitations were documented in several studies. Eye contact detection misrecognition issues were reported by Yun et al. (2016), while Costa et al. (2014) experienced problems with QR code reading systems. Additionally, Qidwai & Shakir (2013) noted specific issues with IR line-of-sight and sound volume control.

The complexity of maintaining robust operation in real-world settings was highlighted by multiple researchers. Scassellati et al. (2018) reported installation problems and setting constraints when implementing their system in home environments. Similarly, Pistoia et al. (2017) documented technical problems that occasionally interrupted or prevented experimental sessions entirely.

These technical limitations underscore the ongoing challenges in developing and implementing robust technological solutions for supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities, suggesting the need for continued advancement in both hardware reliability and software integration capabilities.

 In the analysis of interaction limitations across the reviewed studies, there were 15 papers out of 97 that explicitly reported various interaction-related challenges and limitations in their robotic interventions, representing approximately 15.5% of the total studies. These limitations encompassed several key areas that affected the effectiveness and naturality of human-robot interactions.

The most frequently reported limitation was the restricted complexity of robot interactions, as noted in multiple studies (Brivio et al., 2021; Lemaignan et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2023; Scassellati et al., 2018). This limitation often manifested as simplified or constrained interaction patterns that failed to capture the complexity of natural human interactions. Several researchers, including Alnajjar et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2020), specifically highlighted limitations in the robots' ability to adapt spontaneously to unexpected situations or user behaviors.

Another significant challenge identified was the difficulty in generalizing learned behaviors to real-world situations, as reported by Taheri et al. (2019) and Sartorato et al. (2017). This limitation suggests a gap between controlled experimental environments and practical applications. Some studies also reported specific technical constraints, such as Soleiman et al. (2014) noting physical interaction limitations due to robot containment requirements, and Reardon et al. (2018) identifying difficulties in maintaining user attention and detecting idle states.

The ability to provide appropriate feedback was another area of concern, with Pennington et al. (2014) specifically noting limitations in the robot's capacity to offer detailed feedback on participant responses. Studies by Kim et al. (2014) and Sandygulova et al. (2019) reported challenges related to the robots' handling of unexpected responses and their overall adaptability in interactive scenarios.

These findings suggest that while robotic interventions show promise, significant technological and design challenges remain in creating truly adaptive and naturalistic human-robot interactions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The limitations identified point to important areas for future research and development in the field of assistive robotics.

 In the analysis of resource limitations across the reviewed studies, there were 5 papers out of 97 that explicitly reported resource-related constraints, representing approximately 5.2% of the total sample. The identified limitations primarily centered around financial constraints and accessibility barriers.

The most frequently cited resource limitation was the high cost associated with robotic technologies. Pennington et al. (2014) and Yin & Tung (2013) specifically highlighted the substantial financial investment required for robot acquisition and manufacturing. Similarly, Sartorato et al. (2017) emphasized both the high costs and limited accessibility as significant barriers to implementation. In their comprehensive scoping review, Santos et al. (2023) identified cost-related challenges as a recurring theme across multiple studies involving robotics for Autism Spectrum Disorder interventions. Resource constraints in implementation were also noted by Brivio et al. (2021) in their work with soft, mobile autonomous robots.

These findings suggest that while technological solutions show promise for enhancing autonomy in individuals with intellectual disabilities, their widespread adoption may be hindered by economic factors. The relatively low percentage of studies reporting resource limitations (5.2%) might not fully reflect the actual scope of this challenge, as studies that could not proceed due to resource constraints would not have been published and thus not included in this review. This underscores the need for more cost-effective solutions and increased funding support to make these technologies more accessible to a broader population of potential users.

 In the systematic review, there were 16 papers out of 97 that explicitly reported research design limitations, representing approximately 16.5% of the total analyzed papers. The reported limitations encompassed various methodological challenges that potentially impacted the robustness and generalizability of the findings.

Several studies highlighted limitations related to experimental settings and methodology. Alnajjar et al. (2021) and Kim et al. (2021) specifically noted concerns regarding artificial experimental settings that might not fully reflect real-world conditions. Chevalier et al. (n.d.) identified limitations in their screen-based robot interaction approach, which may have affected ecological validity. The focus on tool development rather than comprehensive outcome assessment was a recurring limitation, as noted by Charron et al. (2017), Costa et al. (2014), and Sandygulova et al. (2019).

Some researchers acknowledged limitations in understanding intervention mechanisms. De Korte et al. (2020) and Marzano et al. (2021) explicitly mentioned the need for better comprehension of how their interventions functioned. Talaei-Khoeli et al. (2017) noted insufficient depth in examining socio-economic factors and external activities' influence on performance outcomes. Wood et al. (2019) identified issues with participant selection criteria, while Yun et al. (2016) raised concerns about participants' ability to interact with robots independently of therapist assistance.

In terms of assessment limitations, several studies (Sartorato et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2023; Zanatta et al., 2023) emphasized the need for more comprehensive outcome evaluations and targeted investigations of specific quality of life components. Reardon et al. (2018) specifically acknowledged limitations in prompt design and interaction modalities, which could have influenced the effectiveness of their robotic interventions.

These identified limitations underscore the importance of developing more robust research methodologies in future studies, particularly focusing on real-world applications, comprehensive outcome assessments, and better understanding of intervention mechanisms in the context of robotics and artificial intelligence applications for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
-----This is the summary of the info in file: Answers to question A56.txt 
 There were 31 papers that reported outcome limitations in their studies, while 65 papers did not report any significant limitations. The reported limitations can be categorized into several key areas that highlight important considerations in the field of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Individual variability in responses was frequently cited as a significant limitation across multiple studies (Brivio et al., 2021; Conti et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021; Santos et al., 2023; Welch et al., 2023). This variability necessitated the individualization of interventions and posed challenges in developing standardized protocols. The heterogeneous nature of participant responses complicated the generalization of findings and highlighted the need for personalized approaches in robotic interventions.

Limited skill transfer to non-robotic contexts emerged as another prevalent concern (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Boccanfuso et al., 2016; Bonarini et al., 2016; Cervera et al., n.d.). Several researchers noted difficulties in participants' ability to generalize learned skills beyond the robotic intervention setting to real-world situations. This limitation raises questions about the ecological validity of robotic interventions and their practical effectiveness in promoting lasting behavioral changes.

Uncertain long-term sustainability of improvements was consistently reported across studies (Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Charron et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2014; Scassellati et al., 2018). Many researchers acknowledged the lack of longitudinal data to support the durability of observed improvements, suggesting the need for extended follow-up periods to assess the maintenance of acquired skills and behaviors.

Limited evidence of real-world effectiveness was identified as a significant constraint (Conti et al., 2020; De Korte et al., 2020; Marino et al., 2020; Zanatta et al., 2023). This limitation often stemmed from small sample sizes, controlled laboratory settings, and the challenges of implementing robotic interventions in natural environments. The gap between laboratory findings and real-world applications underscores the importance of conducting more extensive field studies to validate the practical utility of robotic interventions.

These findings emphasize the need for future research to address these limitations through longer-term studies, larger sample sizes, and more robust assessment methods for measuring skill transfer and maintenance in natural settings. Additionally, the development of more adaptive and personalized robotic intervention protocols may help address the challenge of individual variability in responses.

 In the systematic review, there were 23 papers that reported assessment limitations, while 73 papers did not mention any assessment-related constraints. The identified limitations predominantly focused on challenges in measuring complex social interactions and difficulties in capturing behavioral nuances during robot-assisted interventions.

Several studies highlighted specific assessment challenges in the context of robot-assisted therapy for individuals with intellectual disabilities. For instance, Marino et al. (2020) and De Korte et al. (2020) reported both difficulty in capturing behavioral nuances and limited depth of assessment when evaluating social-emotional understanding interventions. Studies focusing on social communication skills, such as Marzano et al. (2021) and Nanou et al. (2021), emphasized the challenges in measuring complex social interactions between participants and robotic systems.

In the context of autism-specific research, multiple studies (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Boccanfuso et al., 2016) identified limitations in accurately measuring complex social interactions and behavioral responses. Scassellati et al. (2018) and Shah et al. (2023) specifically noted difficulties in capturing subtle behavioral changes during long-term, in-home interventions. Additionally, studies involving educational applications, such as Reardon et al. (2018), reported challenges in accurately perceiving and assessing student behavior during robot-assisted learning activities.

Some researchers also identified methodological constraints related to data collection and analysis. For example, Rakhymbayeva & Sandygulova (2021) highlighted limitations in engagement assessment due to heterogeneous data, while Zanatta et al. (2023) reported challenges in measuring complex outcomes and achieving sufficient depth of assessment in their systematic review of robot-assisted therapy combined with virtual reality.

These assessment limitations underscore the complexity of evaluating robot-assisted interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities and suggest the need for more sophisticated assessment tools and methodologies in future research.

 In the systematic review, there were 18 papers out of 96 that reported implementation limitations in their studies, representing approximately 19% of the total analyzed papers. These limitations encompassed various aspects that affected the deployment and effectiveness of the technological interventions.

The most frequently reported implementation challenges were related to limited replicability and setting-specific constraints. Several studies, including Alnajjar et al. (2021), Marzano et al. (2021), and Santos et al. (2023), specifically highlighted difficulties in replicating their interventions across different contexts. Setting-specific constraints were particularly emphasized in studies by Brivio et al. (2021) and Costa et al. (2014), who noted that the experimental setup and room configuration significantly influenced the intervention's effectiveness.

Technical limitations regarding device operation and system reliability were also prominent. Simlesa et al. (2022) reported inconsistent device operation, while Pistoia et al. (2017) noted that parents experienced difficulties operating the system independently without professional assistance. The integration of complex technologies often presented challenges in maintaining consistent functionality, as documented by Wood et al. (2019), who reported difficulties in maintaining consistent progression criteria due to varied participant abilities.

Adaptability limitations were another significant concern. Scassellati et al. (2018) and Zanatta et al. (2023) specifically mentioned limited adaptability to diverse needs as a key implementation challenge. This limitation was particularly relevant in educational settings, where Lemaignan et al. (2022) emphasized the importance of considering robots as teaching aids while acknowledging their implementation constraints.

Resource-dependent implementation was also identified as a limiting factor. Studies by Kim et al. (2014) and Reardon et al. (2018) highlighted the need for specific resources and improvements in interaction fluency and instruction detail. These resource requirements often posed challenges for widespread implementation, particularly in settings with limited access to technical support or specialized equipment.
