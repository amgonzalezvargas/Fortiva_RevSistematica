<Context> I uploaded here an academic paper. I'm reading it as part  of a systematic review about  Technologies for Enhancing Autonomy in Adults with Intellectual Disabilities

<Alert> If you don't find a file uploaded with this prompt, don't proceed with the rest, just respond "YOU DIDN'T UPLOAD ANY FILE"

<Instructions> I want you to extract from the paper the answer to each one of the 20 questions in <Questions>. If you can't find an answer for any of the questions, answer N/A and explain why.

<Answer structure> Your answer should be only one json object (don't add any other explanatory, introductory or final text), the fields and their contents should be these:
"File_name": name of the uploaded document,
"Paper_title": title of the paper, 
"Reference": Full APA reference,
"Citation": APA in-line citation (Author, year), 
"A1": Answer 1,
