The Michigan Department of Corrections operates the Vocational Villages, which 
are skilled trades training programs set within prisons that include an 
immersive educational community using virtual reality, robotics, and other 
technologies to develop employable trades. An enhancement to the Vocational 
Villages could be an evidence-based job interview training component. Recently, 
we conducted a series of randomized controlled trials funded by the National 
Institute of Mental Health to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality job 
interview training (VR-JIT). The results suggested that the use of VR-JIT was 
associated with improved job interview skills and a greater likelihood of 
receiving job offers within 6 months. The primary goal of this study is to 
report on the protocol we developed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-JIT at 
improving interview skills, increasing job offers, and reducing recidivism when 
delivered within two Vocational Villages via a randomized controlled trial and 
process evaluation. Our aims are to: (1) evaluate whether services-as-usual in 
combination with VR-JIT, compared to services-as-usual alone, enhances 
employment outcomes and reduces recidivism among returning citizens enrolled in 
the Vocational Villages; (2) evaluate mechanisms of employment outcomes and 
explore mechanisms of recidivism; and (3) conduct a multilevel, mixed-method 
process evaluation of VR-JIT implementation to assess the adoptability, 
acceptability, scalability, feasibility, and implementation costs of VR-JIT.

Conflict of interest statement: Dr. Matthew Smith will receive royalties on 
sales of an adapted, unpublished (at the time of this submission) version of 
virtual reality job interview training (VR-JIT) that will focus on meeting the 
needs of transition-age youth with autism spectrum disorders. Dr. Smith's 
research on the effectiveness of the adapted version of VR-JIT is independent of 
the protocol proposed in this manuscript that will be evaluating the original 
version of VR-JIT. No other authors report any conflicts of interest.

BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard of 
evidence-based practice in medicine but they have had limited influence in the 
field of intellectual disabilities. Previous literature suggests that 
participants and professionals have limited tolerance for this type of research 
methodology. However, it is not known how well service users, carers and other 
health professionals understand and accept the need for RCTs, and why it is 
important for individuals with intellectual disabilities to be included in this 
kind of research.
METHODS: We examined individual perceptions of RCTs in 51 participants (18 
carers, 6 service users and 27 professionals) using semi-structured interviews. 
A framework approach was adopted in the analysis of data.
RESULTS: We found that participants had concerns about capacity and resource 
allocation but held positive views towards this type of research methodology. 
Understanding of the principles behind RCTs was poor amongst service users and a 
minority of carers, but mediated by previous exposure to research for 
professionals.
CONCLUSIONS: The social validity of RCTs in intellectual disabilities may be 
compromised by lack of understanding of the design and the on-going concerns 
about obtaining informed consent especially in incapacitated adults. However, 
the overall finding that the need for this form of research was seen in a 
positive light suggests that there is a turning point in the perceptions of 
stakeholders working in intellectual disabilities services. We recommend that 
researchers include on-going education on RCT design during trials, tailoring it 
to all stakeholders with emphasis on strong service user and care involvement. 
This could be a pivotal element in improving acceptability of, and recruitment 
to RCTs.

Cognitive abilities similar to other mental or physical abilities develop and 
change during the course of life. Spatial processing is a cognitive ability, 
which has been suggested to deteriorate by age. The focus of this paper is to 
study the change of real time egocentric spatial processing in humans by age. 
For this, an interactive computer game played with a 2DOF manipulandum was 
designed. The game consists of goal-oriented motor tasks, in which the player 
must move the robot arm toward a desired spatial cue in a virtual 2D environment 
in every trial for a total number of 72 trials. The spatial cues are four final 
destinations and a starting location, which change their position in every new 
trial of the game. 37 individuals with no cognitive impairment were split into 3 
groups according to different age range (children, young, and elderly) and 
participated in this experiment. Their spatial processing ability was assessed 
and compared between the age groups. The results show the children (7-12 y) and 
elderly (65(+) y) performed very similar and significantly worse than the young 
adult participants.
