Traditional rehabilitation approaches, which primarily depend on physical training and manual assistance, have several limitations, including prolonged treatment duration, low patient engagement, and limited enhancement of neural plasticity. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly focused on integrating brain-computer interface (BCI) technology with robotic rehabilitation systems (Wolpaw et al., 2020) [1]. Among various BCI technologies, noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI has emerged as a promising approach for motor function rehabilitation owing to its non-invasiveness, safety, and high accessibility. This technique records brain signals in real time using electrodes placed on the scalp (Wang, 2021) [2], analyzes motor intentions using artificial intelligence algorithms, and integrates exoskeletons, functional electrical stimulation or virtual reality devices to establish a “perception-feedback” closed-loop training system, accelerating the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the motor pathway (Stoyell et al., 2021) [3]. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BCI; EEG; Motor rehabilitation robots","","","","Wolpaw, J.

Traditional interventions often rely on role-playing games with human therapists or inanimate objects, but these approaches may lack consistency and ecological validity. This study integrated Applied Behavior Analysis principles with robot-assisted training to improve social cognition in children with autism. A randomized, two-period crossover trial involving 32 children (mean age = 7.53 ± 1.32 years, 7 females) compared robot-assisted training using the humanoid robot iCub with standard therapy and an active human-assisted control condition. During robot-assisted sessions, children engaged in structured social role-play scenarios, practicing essential social skills such as perspective-taking, joint attention, and recognizing intentions. The robot’s human-like appearance and adaptive behavior provided an engaging, predictable learning environment. Results indicated that robot-assisted training significantly improved social cognition, in contrast to traditional therapy and the human-assisted control group, where no improvements were found. Importantly, the active human control confirmed that these improvements were driven by the robot’s presence rather than the protocol itself. These findings demonstrate the potential of humanoid robots as effective therapeutic tools for enhancing social skills in children with autism, offering a scalable and engaging complement to existing clinical practices.

This study evaluates stakeholders’ acceptance of a RAT-scenario designed to train emotion recognition and regulation in AS children using Softbank Robotics Pepper, a humanoid robot with an integrated tablet screen, compared to a tablet-based therapy (TBT) control. An online survey of 123 stakeholders (caregivers, professionals, and autistic adults) assessed RAT and TBT using global acceptance, intention to use, and acceptance-related factors (ALMERE model), alongside stakeholders’ concerns. While a larger proportion of stakeholders (58%) showed high global acceptance of RAT, stakeholders preferred TBT across measures and groups (p <.001, Wilk’s Λ = 0.595), potentially due to its established familiarity and easier usability. The intention to use RAT was predicted by perceived usefulness, and, to a smaller extent, perceived ease of use, and affinity for technology, independent of stakeholder group. Concerns mainly addressed the expected effort to implement RAT in therapeutic services. Overall, the results highlight stakeholder acceptance and underscore the need to enhance RAT’s perceived usefulness and ease of implementation, suggesting a user-centered design approach for future deployments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; autism; child; comparative study; female; human; male; middle aged; personal digital assistant; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; robotics; stakeholder participation; therapy; Adult; Autistic Disorder; Child; Computers, Handheld; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Robotics; Stakeholder Participation; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO Icd 10 Gm Internationale Statistische Klassifikation Der Krankheiten Und Verwandter Gesundheitsprobleme, (2017); Dziobek, Isabel, Introducing MASC: A movie for the assessment of social cognition, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 36, 5, pp. 623-636, (2006); Gaigg, Sebastian B., The interplay between emotion and cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Implications for developmental theory, Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience, NOV, (2012); Kliemann, Dorit, The role of the amygdala in atypical gaze on emotional faces in autism spectrum disorders, Journal of Neuroscience, 32, 28, pp. 9469-9476, (2012); HOWLIN, P., Adult outcome for children with autism, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 45, 2, pp. 212-229, (2004); Stewart, Mary Elizabeth, Presentation of depression in autism and Asperger syndrome: A review, Autism, 10, 1, pp. 103-116, (2006); Mazefsky, Carla A., The role of emotion regulation in autism spectrum disorder, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 52, 7, pp. 679-688, (2013); Scarcella, Ileana, Information and communication technologies-based interventions for children with autism spectrum conditions: a systematic review of randomized control trials from a positive technology perspective, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 14, (2023); Kirst, Simone, Fostering socio-emotional competencies in children on the autism spectrum using a parent-assisted serious game: A multicenter randomized controlled trial, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 152, (2022); Beaumont, Renae B., A new computerised advanced theory of mind measure for children with Asperger syndrome: The ATOMIC, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, 2, pp. 249-260, (2008)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20452322","","","40175476","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001738403"

Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine outcomes across time associated with a robotics program for children with ASD while accounting for a variety of relevant variables, including the degree of ASD symptoms, presence of ADHD symptoms, degree of challenging behaviors, quality of relationships, and sensory sensitivity. Participants included 12 elementary students with a diagnosis ASD who were enrolled in a community-based after-school program for students with ASD. Participants engaged in robotics and coding activities across 7 weeks through structured and unstructured exploration. Engagement and diagnostic markers were observed as students participated in robotics and coding tasks. Additionally, measures were obtained for indications of ASD, ADHD, quality of relationships, challenging behaviors, and sensory sensitivity. Data were used to evaluate the association of ASD diagnostic marker and engagement scores across time via the number of sessions. Results show a decrease in participants’ diagnostic ASD markers and an increase in engagement as sessions progressed. Background variables such as presence of ADHD symptoms, challenging behaviors, and sensory sensitivities did not significantly influence outcomes, suggesting that the design of robotics and coding programs for students with ASD need not hinge upon on these factors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","After school programs; ASD; Autism; Coding; Computer science; Informal learning; Robotics; STEM","","","","American Psychiatric Association, (2022); Anderson, Nathan P., National Norms for the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale in Children, Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 47, 6, pp. 652-661, (2022); Antshel, Kevin M., Autism Spectrum Disorders and ADHD: Overlapping Phenomenology, Diagnostic Issues, and Treatment Considerations, Current Psychiatry Reports, 21, 5, (2019); Auyeung, Bonnie, The autism spectrum quotient: Children's version (AQ-Child), Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, 7, pp. 1230-1240, (2008); Begum, Momotaz, Are Robots Ready to Deliver Autism Interventions?

Traditional measures fail to fully capture the risks associated with a child's development outcomes. Artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning (ML), offer an innovative approach by analysing complex datasets to detect subtle developmental patterns. Objective To map the existing literature on the use of ML in ECD research, including its geographical distribution, to identify research gaps and inform future directions. The review focuses on applied ML techniques, data types, feature sets, outcomes, data splitting and validation strategies, model performance, model explainability, key themes, clinical relevance and reported limitations. Design Scoping review using the Arksey and O € Malley framework with enhancements by Levac et al. Data sources A systematic search was conducted on 16 June 2024 across PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and PsycINFO, supplemented by grey literature (OpenGrey) and reference hand-searching. No publication date limits were applied. Eligibility criteria Included studies applied ML or its variants (eg, deep learning (DL), natural language processing) to developmental outcomes in children aged 0-8 years. Studies were in English and addressed cognitive, language, motor or social-emotional development. Excluded were studies focusing on robotics; neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and communication disorders; disease or medical conditions; and review articles. Data extraction and charting Three reviewers independently extracted data using a structured MS Excel template, covering study ML techniques, data types, feature sets, outcomes, outcome measures, data splitting and validation strategies, model performance, model explainability, key themes, clinical relevance and limitations. A narrative synthesis was conducted, supported by descriptive statistics and visualisations. Results Of the 759 articles retrieved, 27 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (78%) originated from high-income countries, with none from sub-Saharan Africa. Supervised ML classifiers (40.7%) and DL techniques (22.2%) were the most used approaches. Cognitive development was the most frequently targeted outcome (33.3%), often measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (33.3%). Data types varied, with image, video and sensor-based data being most prevalent. Key predictive features were grouped into six categories: brain features; anthropometric and clinical/biological markers; socio-demographic and environmental factors; medical history and nutritional indicators; linguistic and expressive features; and motor indicators. Most studies (74.1%) focused solely on prediction, with the majority conducting predictions at age 2 years and above. Only 41% of studies employed explainability methods, and validation strategies varied widely. Few studies (7.4%) conducted external validation, and only one had progressed to a clinical trial. Common limitations included small sample sizes, lack of external validation and imbalanced datasets. Conclusion There is growing interest in using ML for ECD research, but current research lacks geographical diversity, external validation, explainability and practical implementation. Future work should focus on developing inclusive, interpretable and externally validated models that are integrated into real-world implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child; Cognition; Machine Learning","academic success; Africa south of the Sahara; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; child; childhood; classifier; clinical significance; cognition; cognitive development; deep learning; emotional development; environmental factor; geographic distribution; high income country; human; machine learning; medical history; Medline; middle income country; motor development; natural language processing; outcome assessment; prediction; psychological development; scoping review; transfer of learning; videorecording; Web of Science; child development; infant; preschool child; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Machine Learning","","","BMJ Glob Health, (2019); Arnold, David H., The Early Education of Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Children, Annual Review of Psychology, 54, pp. 517-545, (2003); Maggi, Stefania, The social determinants of early child development: An overview, Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health, 46, 11, pp. 627-635, (2010); Cureus, (2022); Black, Maureen M., Early childhood development coming of age: science through the life course, The Lancet, 389, 10064, pp. 77-90, (2017); Grantham-McGregor, Sally M., Developmental potential in the first 5 years for children in developing countries, The Lancet, 369, 9555, pp. 60-70, (2007); Rahman, Atif, Can maternal depression increase infant risk of illness and growth impairment in developing countries?, Child: Care, Health and Development, 28, 1, pp. 51-56, (2002); Walker, Susan P., Child development: risk factors for adverse outcomes in developing countries, The Lancet, 369, 9556, pp. 145-157, (2007); Krishnan, Gokul, Artificial intelligence in clinical medicine: catalyzing a sustainable global healthcare paradigm, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 6, (2023); Ahsan, Md Manjurul, Machine-Learning-Based Disease Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Review, Healthcare (Switzerland), 10, 3, (2022)","","BMJ Publishing Group","","","","","","20446055","","","40829824","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013553563"

Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) has long been a cornerstone in the treatment of MB, especially for patients with high-risk or metastatic disease. However, CSI often leads to long-term neurocognitive deficits, including learning disabilities, and growth abnormalities, especially in children. In this study, we aimed to decrease the dose of irradiation and the proliferation of MB by using Volasertib (VSB), a Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) specific inhibitor. VSB was highly potent in-vitro with an IC<inf>50</inf> of 27.43 nM and 13 nM in HDMB03 and DAOY cells, respectively. However, in the orthotopic MB mouse model, VSB as a free drug did not improve overall survival or decrease tumor burden. Hence, we encapsulated VSB in COG133-conjugated lipid nanoparticles (COG133-LNPs) to circumvent the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We observed that COG-133-LNPs loaded with VSB increased the biodistribution of VSB by three folds than the non-targeted LNPs in the brain. Furthermore, COG133-LNPs along with irradiation decreased tumor burden significantly as compared to VSB or radiation alone. To our observation, COG133-LNPs display high potency in killing MB cells and sensitizing them toward radiation therapy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ApoE mimetic peptide; Lipid nanoparticles; Medulloblastoma; PLK1 inhibitor; Radiation therapy; Volasertib","Chemotherapy; Drug delivery; Drug dosage; Drug infusion; Medicaments; Robotic surgery; Apoe mimetic peptide; Craniospinal irradiation; Lipid nanoparticles; Malignant brain tumour; Medulloblastoma; Mimetics; Polo-like kinase 1; Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor; Spinal-cord; Volasertib; Radiotherapy; apolipoprotein E; lipid nanoparticle; polo like kinase 1; volasertib; cell cycle protein; lipid; Lipid Nanoparticles; liposome; nanoparticle; protein serine threonine kinase; proto oncogene protein; pteridine derivative; radiosensitizing agent; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; blood brain barrier; cancer cell; cell migration assay; cell proliferation; cell viability assay; cerebellum; colony formation; comparative study; controlled study; craniospinal irradiation; Daoy cell line; DNA damage; effective dose (pharmacology); electron microscopy; IC50; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; lambdoid suture; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; medulloblastoma; mouse; multiple reaction monitoring; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; overall survival; protein expression; radiation field; room temperature; sensitizer enhancement ratio; spinal cord; tumor burden; tumor cell; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor spheroid; Western blotting; X irradiation; animal; cerebellum tumor; chemistry; drug therapy; female; human; nude mouse; pathology; radiotherapy; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cerebellar Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Lipids; Liposomes; Mice; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Polo-Like Kinase 1; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Pteridines; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents","","doublecortin like kinase 1; germinal center kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; NIMA related kinase 1; oncogene protein v akt; oncogene protein v raf; polo like kinase 1; serine threonine protein kinase 3; serine threonine protein kinase ULK1; serine/threonine protein kinase WNK1; volasertib, 755038-65-4, 946161-17-7; lipid, 66455-18-3; protein serine threonine kinase; Cell Cycle Proteins; Lipid Nanoparticles; Lipids; Liposomes; Polo-Like Kinase 1; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Pteridines; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents","Kumar, Vinod, Challenges and Recent Advances in Medulloblastoma Therapy, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 38, 12, pp. 1061-1084, (2017); Baumann, Michael A., Exploring the role of cancer stem cells in radioresistance, Nature Reviews Cancer, 8, 7, pp. 545-554, (2008); Inoue, Minoru, PLK1 blockade enhances therapeutic effects of radiation by inducing cell cycle arrest at the mitotic phase, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Harris, Peter S., Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibition suppresses cell growth and enhances radiation sensitivity in medulloblastoma cells, BMC Cancer, 12, (2012); Gjertsen, Björn Tore, Discovery and development of the Polo-like kinase inhibitor volasertib in cancer therapy, Leukemia, 29, 1, pp. 11-19, (2015); Pajonk, Frank, Radiation resistance of cancer stem cells: The 4 R's of radiobiology revisited, Stem Cells, 28, 4, pp. 639-648, (2010); Pawlik, Timothy M., Role of cell cycle in mediating sensitivity to radiotherapy, International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, 59, 4, pp. 928-942, (2004); undefined, (2024); undefined, (2024); Wang, Dongrui, Chlorotoxin-directed CAR T cells for specific and effective targeting of glioblastoma, Science Translational Medicine, 12, 533, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01683659; 18734995","","JCREE","40449803","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007111593"

We define assistive technologies as digital tools used directly by AwDS to assist them in performing a task or achieving a goal. The review aimed to: (1) examine how researchers have involved AwDS in the design and evaluation of technologies; (2) identify the types of technologies explored and the motivations driving their use; (3) assess how these technologies support abilities across life domains; and (4) analyze the reported benefits, challenges, and design implications. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we searched six academic databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Compendex, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink), resulting in 1,944 articles. After applying the inclusion criteria, we identified 20 studies for in-depth analysis. Methods ranged from experimental to participatory design, with inclusive strategies such as caregiver involvement, visual aids, and personalized supports frequently reported. Technologies identified included computers and web platforms, mobile applications, AAC systems, smart home tools, and social robots, supporting areas like daily living, communication, learning, navigation, and health. Reported benefits included increased independence and digital inclusion, enhanced communication, expanded social connection, greater confidence and engagement, and enhanced skill development. Common challenges included interface complexity, lack of context-aware interaction, environmental and sensory constraints, and uneven impact across users. Based on these findings and paper analysis, we outline five design recommendations: reduce interaction complexity, support engagement through feedback and flexible pacing, enable personalization and long-term adaptability, provide accessible pathways to secure system access, and embed technology within everyday routines. This review emphasizes the importance of inclusive, user-centered systems that align with the goals, contexts, and lived experiences of AwDS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assistive technologies; Cognitive disability; Down syndrome; Literature review; Scoping review; Technology outcomes for persons with disabilities","Assistive technology; Digital devices; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent robots; Social computing; Social sciences computing; User centered design; User experience; User interfaces; Cognitive disability; Design and evaluations; Digital tools; Down's syndrome; Evaluation of technology; Literature reviews; Persons with disabilities; Scoping review; Technology outcome for person with disability; Digital libraries","","","Iso 9241 11 1998 Ergonomic Requirements for Office Work with Visual Display Terminals Vdts Part 11 Guidance on Usability, (2025); Afonseca, Catia, Supporting collective learning experiences in special education: Development and pilot evaluation of an interactive learning tool for down syndrome, (2013); Agree, Emily M., The potential for technology to enhance independence for those aging with a disability, Disability and Health Journal, 7, 1 SUPPL, pp. S33-S39, (2014); Alemi, Minoo, An innovative approach of incorporating a humanoid robot into teaching EFL learners with intellectual disabilities, Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education, 4, 1, (2019); Gómez-Álvarez, Nicolás, Effect of an intervention based on virtual reality on motor development and postural control in children with down syndrome, Revista Chilena de Pediatria, 89, 6, pp. 747-752, (2018); Antonarakis, Stylianos E., Down syndrome, Nature Reviews Disease Primers, 6, 1, (2020); Aruanno, Beatrice, Hololearn: Wearable mixed reality for people with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), pp. 40-51, (2018); Aziz, Naziatul Shima Abdul, User experience study on mobile numerical application for children with mental disabilities, pp. 118-122, (2014); Bainbridge, Kathleen E., Hearing loss in an aging American population: Extent, impact, and management, Annual Review of Public Health, 35, pp. 139-152, (2014); Baksh, R.

A quasiexperimental research design was adopted with 109 older adults from 8 long-term care facilities and day-care centers assigned to the experimental (n = 52) and comparison groups (n = 57). The experimental group underwent a 12-week cognitive training program. Both groups completed before-and-after and 3-month follow-up measurements for outcome variables, including cognitive function (scores of mini-mental state examination [MMSE] and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog]), depression, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. The data were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). The program’s usability was assessed using the system usability scale (SUS). The GEE analyses revealed significant postintervention improvements in the experimental group’s MMSE, ADAS-Cog, depression, general self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life scores. These effects persisted for the 3-month follow-up. The mean SUS score was 87.50, indicating the feasibility of robot-assisted interventions among older adults. These findings confirmed that interactive robot-assisted board games can improve cognitive function, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction and reduce depression among older adults. The administration of long-term care facilities or day-care centers can adopt robot-assisted board games as a training tool to supplement health promotion activities to prevent cognitive deterioration and enhance mental health among older adults. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","board game; cognitive training; human-robot interaction; mild cognitive impairment; older adults; robot-assisted training","aged; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; devices; female; human; male; mental health; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial; robotics; self concept; therapy; very elderly; video game; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Robotics; Self Efficacy; Video Games","","","Bradfield, Nicholas I., Mild cognitive impairment: Narrative review of taxonomies and systematic review of their prediction of incident Alzheimer's disease dementia, BJPsych Bulletin, 44, 2, pp. 67-74, (2020); Jongsiriyanyong, Sukanya, Mild Cognitive Impairment in Clinical Practice: A Review Article, American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease and other Dementias, 33, 8, pp. 500-507, (2018); Sachs-Ericsson, Natalie J., The new DSM-5 diagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder and its relation to research in mild cognitive impairment, Aging and Mental Health, 19, 1, pp. 2-12, (2015); Liu, Xueyan, The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia among rural dwellers: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Geriatric Nursing, 56, pp. 74-82, (2024); Manly, Jennifer Jaie, Estimating the Prevalence of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment in the US: The 2016 Health and Retirement Study Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol Project, JAMA Neurology, 79, 12, pp. 1242-1249, (2022); Jia, Longfei, Prevalence, risk factors, and management of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in adults aged 60 years or older in China: a cross-sectional study, The Lancet Public Health, 5, 12, pp. e661-e671, (2020); Vuic, Barbara, Tailoring the therapeutic interventions for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 22, 8, pp. 707-720, (2022); Zhang, Haifeng, Effect of computerised cognitive training on cognitive outcomes in mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis, BMJ Open, 9, 8, (2019); Basak, Chandramallika, Differential effects of cognitive training modules in healthy aging and mild cognitive impairment: A comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials., Psychology and Aging, 35, 2, pp. 220-249, (2020); Nguyen, Lan, Cognitive and neural plasticity in old age: A systematic review of evidence from executive functions cognitive training, Ageing Research Reviews, 53, (2019)","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","","","","","","21617856; 2161783X","","","39932829","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217701463"

Traditional interventions, though beneficial, may require substantial resources and may not always accommodate the diverse sensory and cognitive needs of children with ASD. Digital interventions, including mobile applications, virtual reality (VR), and robot-assisted therapy, provide flexible and engaging alternatives by utilizing structured, interactive, and visually enriched environments tailored to the strengths of children with ASD. Method: This integrative review, conducted following PRISMA guidelines, analyzed studies published between 2011 and 2022 to explore how various digital interventions support communication and collaboration skills in children with ASD. Eleven studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected from databases such as Google Scholar, ERIC, and PsycINFO. A qualitative synthesis of findings was performed, considering study methodologies, target skills, and reported outcomes. Results: Findings suggest that mobile applications, particularly those incorporating speech-generating devices, facilitate verbal communication in younger children. Robot-assisted therapy has shown potential in enhancing nonverbal communication, such as eye contact and gestures, while VR and game-based learning promote collaborative behaviors like turn-taking and joint problem-solving. Although some studies reported effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d = 0.32 [0.12–0.51]), the heterogeneity in study designs and intervention types limits direct comparisons. Instead, trends across studies indicate promising advancements in digital support for social and communication development in children with ASD. Conclusion: Digital interventions offer valuable opportunities for enhancing social and communication skills in children with ASD. While these tools complement traditional therapeutic approaches, variability in intervention designs and sample sizes suggests the need for further research to refine their implementation in educational and clinical settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Collaboration Mobile apps; Communication; Digital interventions; Robot-assisted therapy; Virtual reality","","","","Al-Rashaida, Mohammad, Studying the Effects of Mobile Devices on Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Systematic Literature Review, Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 9, 3, pp. 400-415, (2022); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2023); Digital Competence Framework for Citizens Digcomp 2 1 Jrc106281, (2018); Farhan, Sk Adif, Improvement of Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication Skills of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder using Human Robot Interaction, pp. 356-359, (2021); Understanding Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders Educators Partnering with Families, (2013); Hanna, Nicole, Apps to Teach Social Skills to Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Review of the Embedded Behaviour Change Procedures, Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 9, 4, pp. 453-469, (2022); undefined, (2017); Kamaruzaman, Nurul Nadhrah, Digital Game-Based Learning for Low Functioning Autism Children in Learning Al-Quran, pp. 184-189, (2015); Karami, Behnam, Effectiveness of Virtual/Augmented Reality–Based Therapeutic Interventions on Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 12, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","30506565","","","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018028742"

While adenotonsillectomy (AT) remains the first-line treatment, a substantial proportion of patients—especially those with obesity, craniofacial anomalies, or comorbid conditions—exhibit persistent or recurrent symptoms, underscoring the need for individualized and multimodal approaches. This review provides an updated and comprehensive overview of current and emerging treatments for pediatric OSAS, with a focus on both surgical and non-surgical options, including pharmacological, orthodontic, and myofunctional therapies. A narrative synthesis of recent literature was conducted, including systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and large cohort studies published in the last 10 years. The review emphasizes evidence-based indications, mechanisms of action, efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and limitations of each therapeutic modality. Adjunctive and alternative treatments such as rapid maxillary expansion, mandibular advancement devices, myofunctional therapy, intranasal corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and hypoglossal nerve stimulation show promising results in selected patient populations. Personalized treatment plans based on anatomical, functional, and developmental characteristics are essential to optimize outcomes. Combination therapies appear particularly effective in children with residual disease after AT or with specific phenotypes such as Down syndrome or maxillary constriction. Pediatric OSAS requires a tailored, multidisciplinary approach that evolves with the child’s growth and clinical profile. Understanding the full spectrum of available therapies allows clinicians to move beyond a one-size-fits-all model, offering more precise and durable treatment pathways. Emerging strategies may further redefine the therapeutic landscape in the coming years. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adenotonsillectomy; continuous positive airway pressure; myofunctional therapy; orthodontic interventions; pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome","corticosteroid; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; adenotonsillectomy; apnea hypopnea index; assisted ventilation; child; clinical effectiveness; coblation tonsillotomy; cold steel dissection; continuous positive airway pressure; cryogenic plasma tonsillectomy; cryotonsillectomy; Down syndrome; electrocautery; evidence based practice; harmonic scalpel tonsillectomy; high flow nasal cannula therapy; human; hypoglossal nerve stimulation; laser-assisted serial tonsillectomy; mandibular advancement; medical procedures; microdebrider-assisted intracapsular tonsillotomy; minimal residual disease; multidisciplinary care; muscle training; nerve stimulation; neuromodulation; noninvasive ventilation; obstructive sleep apnea; orthodontic procedure; palatal expansion; patient safety; pediatric patient; personalized medicine; phenotype; positional therapy; radiofrequency ablation; rapid maxillary expansion; Review; supraglottoplasty; surgical technique; tonsillectomy; tonsillotomy; tracheostomy; transoral robotic surgery; turbinoplasty; uvulopalatopharyngoplasty","","","Marcus, Carole L., Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Pediatrics, 130, 3, pp. e714-e755, (2012); Bitners, Anna C., Evaluation and Management of Children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome, Lung, 198, 2, pp. 257-270, (2020); Lein, Alexander L., Association of adenoid hypertrophy and clinical parameters with preoperative polygraphy in pediatric patients undergoing adenoidectomy, European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, 282, 2, pp. 1075-1084, (2025); Lumeng, Julie C., Epidemiology of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society, 5, 2, pp. 242-252, (2008); Fernandez-Mendoza, Julio J., Association of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea with elevated blood pressure and orthostatic hypertension in adolescence, JAMA Cardiology, 6, 10, pp. 1144-1151, (2021); Halbower, Ann Carol, Childhood obstructive sleep apnea associates with neuropsychological deficits and neuronal brain injury, PLOS Medicine, 3, 8, pp. 1391-1402, (2006); Smith, David F., OSA and Cardiovascular Risk in Pediatrics, Chest, 156, 2, pp. 402-413, (2019); Katz, Eliot S., Pathophysiology of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society, 5, 2, pp. 253-262, (2008); Reuveni, Haim, Health care services utilization in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Pediatrics, 110, 1 I, pp. 68-72, (2002); Petrongari, Duilio, Risk and Protective Factors for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome Throughout Lifespan: From Pregnancy to Adolescence, Children, 12, 2, (2025)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22279067","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011531663"

It is generally overseen by a qualified therapist or equestrian instructor, and serves as a rehabilitation tool amalgamating equine and therapeutic techniques to alleviate conditions such as cerebral palsy and autism. Whilst equine therapy has demonstrated efficacy in rehabilitating particular conditions, its dissemination is impeded by several constraints and challenges. Furthermore, equine therapy presents a number of limitations and challenges. High expenses, specialised facilities, and the specificity of horses impede the implementation of the therapy on a broader scale. Furthermore, challenges related to individual variations and the requirement for specialised therapist training need to be addressed, alongside cost, resource, and training concerns, to ensure wider adoption of equine therapy. To promote its application, an alternative to conventional biological equine exercise rehabilitation therapy could be a horse-riding rehabilitation robot. Such a development could improve the accessibility and effectiveness of equine therapy on a broader scale. The horse saddle during various gaits involves four primary movements: up and down, forwards and backwards, left and right tilting, and forward and backward tilting. These movements are integral to understanding the saddle’s function. Clear conceptualization of these movements is essential for riding and safely using the horse saddle. Methods Therefore, the robot horse mechanism must possess the four degrees of freedom mentioned earlier. The high load and stiffness requirements when accommodating a person have been taken into account in the design process. As a result, a 3-RPS parallel mechanism is selected as the primary component, capable of carrying out up-and-down movement, left-right tilt, and forward-backward tilt of the saddle. The sketch of the mechanism is demonstrated in Fig. The saddle’s forward-and-backward movement is achieved through one moving vice, while another facilitates the up-and-down and back-and-forth movements. To reduce load and inertia, the mobile vice is mounted on the parallel mechanism’s moving platform. Together, the parallel mechanism and mobile vice comprise a 3-RPS-P hybrid robot. The mechanism possesses excellent stiffness, high load-carrying capacity, and remarkable flexibility, fulfilling the requirements for the saddle centre’s movement during rehabilitation therapy and load carrying capacity during horse riding. Firstly, the robot’s kinematic model was established, followed by deriving the analytical solution for the inverse kinematics. The positive kinematics solution was then obtained by utilising Newton’s iterative computation method. The relationship between the robot’s operational space and the joint space velocity Jacobian was investigated. Additionally, the robot’s workspace was analysed while considering the restriction of motion, and a spatial image was plotted accordingly. Finally, using Lagrange’s method, the dynamics of the parallel mechanism were established. Next, an examination is conducted on the correlation between the motion of the mechanism and the force applied. The motion theories outlined above have been compared and analyzed through examples, and the results have confirmed their validity and accuracy. These theories have then been transferred into MATLAB code, and the robot end’s path and trajectory planning and design have been carried out. Results and Discussions A joint motion simulation of the robot utilizing the SolidWorks Motion module has also been conducted, demonstrating a consistent and smooth trajectory in line with the planning and design objectives. This simulation showcases the robot’s ability to successfully attain its set goals and objectives. The simulation is seamlessly executed and aligns with the planned and designed objectives, demonstrating the robot’s capability to accomplish the designated position-planning motion. Furthermore, it verifies the theoretical analysis outcomes. Finally, the experimental platform for the horse-riding rehabilitation robot was established in order to conduct motion experiments for position planning in motion simulation. The experimental results confirmed the rationality of the mechanism, attained the intended motion trajectory, and showcased rapid response of the control system. Due to the complexity of its calculations, the kinematics of the positive solution is time-consuming, taking 2~3 ms. However, as the display and monitoring meet usage requirements, this signifies that the hybrid horse rehabilitation robot possesses the necessary movement ability for equestrian therapy. Conclusions The locomotive behavior of horses in various gaits, including fast walking, running, and jumping, will be further examined through the study of the robot. To analyse the impact of varying movement gaits, amplitudes and speeds on rehabilitation therapy and optimise mechanism and motion control with input from equestrian therapists’ riding feedback and suggestions. Additionally, establish a real-time feedback system within the machine’s simulation of horse movement to monitor and adjust the robot’s motion status.

Here, we aimed to investigate the use of the QTrobot with the Rehabilitation Robotic Companion for Children and Caregivers (R2C3) robotic platform in the context of a social skills group (SSG) for children with ASD. Six children with ASD between 6 and 11 years old were included in this exploratory study, and were randomly exposed to two conditions, active and inactive robotic interface, over ten weeks. We monitored the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) communication and social scores and the number of engagement initiations and responses to social requests after each session. We also qualitatively explored the feasibility and usability of the Wizard of Oz R2C3 in the SSG setting and evaluated the interface design quality using the Design Information Communication Technology Inventory (DICTI). The robot did not hinder the effectiveness of the SSG, as evidenced by the participants’ significant improvement in social skills. The use of R2C3 in active mode was successful and led to a marked increase in engagement based on children’s social initiations, but did not show a significant increase in responses to social requests and ADOS-2 scores. Qualitatively, we observed that the robot promoted children’s social initiations, notably during the early sessions. However, the design of the R2C3 interface posed some limitations. DICTI scores particularly emphasized the lack of personalization by the user and the inability to manage the complexity of the robot’s behaviors, and of the time lag between the Wizard of Oz control and the behavior execution, making the robot’s reactions challenging to integrate into the group’s conversations. This exploratory study is promising as it suggests that the QTrobot with R2C3 interface promotes social initiations in children with ASD. Future studies should delve deeper into this use with a better-suited multi-party interface and more participants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Engagement; Social skills; Socially assistive robot; Wizard of Oz robotic interface","Diagnosis; Pediatrics; Robot applications; Robot learning; Social robots; Autism; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Engagement; Exploratory studies; Robotic interface; Social skills; Socially assistive robots; Wizard of Oz; Wizard of oz robotic interface; Diseases","","","Grossard, Charline, ICT and autism care: State of the art, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, 31, 6, pp. 474-483, (2018); Scassellati, Brian, Robots for use in autism research, Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering, 14, pp. 275-294, (2012); Robots De Nouveaux Partenaires De Soins Psychiques, (2018); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Kruck, Jeanne, Study on the effectiveness of social skills training program available for children with autism spectrum disorder, Journal de Therapie Comportementale et Cognitive, 27, 1, pp. 25-33, (2017); Entrainement Aux Habiletes Sociales Applique A Lautisme, (2011); Gates, Jacquelyn A., Efficacy of group social skills interventions for youth with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Clinical Psychology Review, 52, pp. 164-181, (2017); Campbell Systematic Reviews, (2012); McMahon, Camilla M., Measuring changes in social behavior during a social skills intervention for higher-functioning children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43, 8, pp. 1843-1856, (2013); Rao, Patricia A., Social skills interventions for children with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism: A review and recommendations, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, 2, pp. 353-361, (2008)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18754791; 18754805","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002166354"

This population often faces challenges in social interaction, particularly in understanding body language, leading to feelings of isolation and impacting their social lives. The use of robot-agent for practice is increasingly being adopted to address these challenges. In this study, an intelligent robot system was designed to enhance social interactions, particularly focusing on body language, among children with ASD. The system integrated an intelligent robot with a Kinect sensor to detect and execute body language actions, utilizing these developed modules for detecting body movements. This study explored the effects of the developed NAO-Recognitions of Body Languages and Imitation (NAO-RBI) system and analyzed the performance of three participants with ASD in these targeted body languages. The body-language gestures involved: raising a hand, high-five, handshake, ""Please give me,"" ""Come on!,"" arms akimbo with an angry face, and ""Please!"". A multiple-probe design was used to monitor improvements in the targeted actions, with a scoring module developed to gather scores from each participant. Results showed that the NAO-RBI system successfully recognized and demonstrated the seven body language gestures. This highlights the potential of SAR, combined with Kinect technology, to enhance body language skills in children with ASD. Comparing skeletal point data captured by Kinect with predefined standard body skeleton coordinates effectively executed the module functions. Robot-assisted practice proved to be a valuable tool for improving body language understanding and use for social interactions in this population. Further research is needed to optimize the robot and enhance its effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A kinect tool; Autism spectrum disorder; Body-languages; Multiple probe designs; Socially-assistive robots","Bioinformatics; Diseases; Intelligent systems; Microrobots; Robotic arms; Social robots; A kinect tool; Assistive robotics; Autism spectrum disorders; Body language; Children with autisms; Multiple probe design; Probe design; Social development; Social interactions; Socially assistive robots; Intelligent robots","","","Abdi, Jordan, Scoping review on the use of socially assistive robot technology in elderly care, BMJ Open, 8, 2, (2018); Journal of Education and Practice, (2015); Assad-Uz-Zaman, Md, Kinect controlled NAO robot for telerehabilitation, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 30, 1, pp. 224-239, (2020); Belpaeme, Tony, Social robots for education: A review, Science Robotics, 3, 21, (2018); New Trends in Medical and Service Robots, (2017); Cadette, Jessica N., The Effectiveness of Direct Instruction in Teaching Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder to Answer “Wh-” Questions, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 46, 9, pp. 2968-2978, (2016); Res Comput Sci, (2016); Chevalier, Pauline, Do Sensory Preferences of Children with Autism Impact an Imitation Task with a Robot?, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, Part F127194, pp. 177-186, (2017); Attitudes of Children with Autism Towards Ro Bots an Exploratory Study, (2025); Cummings, Louise, Handbook of Pragmatic Language Disorders: Complex and Underserved Populations, pp. 1-732, (2021)","","Springer","","","","","","2366598X; 23665971","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210582466"

Rehabilitation operates on the assumption that individuals with stroke can use visual feedback from their movements or visual cues from a therapist to improve their movements through practice. However, this type of visuomotor learning can be impaired after stroke. It is unclear whether and how learning impairments relate to impairments in movement. Here, we examined the relationship between learning and movement impairments after stroke. Methods: We recruited adults with first-time unilateral stroke and controls matched for overall age and sex. The participants performed a visuomotor learning task in a Kinarm exoskeleton robot. The task assessed how they adapted their reaching movements to a systematic visual disturbance that altered the relationship between the observed and actual motion of their hand. Learning was quantified as the extent to which the participants adapted their movements to the visual disturbance. A separate visually-guided reaching task was used to assess the straightness, direction, smoothness, and duration of their movements. The relationships between visuomotor adaptation and movement were analyzed using Spearman’s correlations. Control data were used to identify impairments in visuomotor adaptation and movement. The independence of these impairments was examined using Fisher’s exact tests. Results: Impairments in visuomotor adaptation (46.3%) and movement (73.2%) were common in participants with stroke (n = 41). We observed weak–moderate correlations between continuous measures of adaptation and movement performance (rho range: −0.44–0.58). Adaptation and movement impairments, identified using the range of performance in the control participants, were statistically independent (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: Movement impairments accounted for 34% of the variance in visuomotor adaptation at best. Our findings suggest that factors other than movement impairments may influence visuomotor adaptation after stroke. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","motor adaptation; motor learning; movement impairment; robotics; stroke recovery; stroke rehabilitation; upper limb","adult; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; duration; female; human; human experiment; learning; learning disorder; male; motor dysfunction; motor learning; robotics; stroke rehabilitation; visuomotor learning","","","Reinkensmeyer, David J., Computational neurorehabilitation: Modeling plasticity and learning to predict recovery, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, 13, 1, (2016); Krakauer, John W., Motor learning: Its relevance to stroke recovery and neurorehabilitation, Current Opinion in Neurology, 19, 1, pp. 84-90, (2006); Leech, Kristan A., Updates in Motor Learning: Implications for Physical Therapist Practice and Education, Physical Therapy, 102, 1, (2022); Krakauer, John W., Motor learning, Comprehensive Physiology, 9, 2, pp. 613-663, (2019); Takahashi, Craig D., Hemiparetic stroke impairs anticipatory control of arm movement, Experimental Brain Research, 149, 2, pp. 131-140, (2003); Scheidt, Robert A., Reach adaptation and final position control amid environmental uncertainty after stroke, Journal of Neurophysiology, 97, 4, pp. 2824-2836, (2007); Wadden, Katie P., Predicting Motor Sequence Learning in Individuals with Chronic Stroke, Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair, 31, 1, pp. 95-104, (2017); Boyd, Lara A., Implicit motor-sequence learning in humans following unilateral stroke: The impact of practice and explicit knowledge, Neuroscience Letters, 298, 1, pp. 65-69, (2001); Schweighofer, Nicolas, Dissociating motor learning from recovery in exoskeleton training post-stroke, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, 15, 1, (2018); Hardwick, Robert M., Motor Learning in Stroke, Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair, 31, 2, pp. 178-189, (2017)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763425","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009135757"

Gaze patterns of ten children (aged 5-10), including eight diagnosed with ASD, were examined during robot-assisted therapy sessions recorded with a fisheye camera in a naturalistic setting. The resulting EMBOA-Gaze dataset was manually annotated at both the gaze target coordinate and the semantic region, categorized as “Robot,” “Therapist,” or “Other.” Statistical analysis showed that children with ASD looked significantly more at the robot than the therapist (p =.002) and the other region (p =.030). A modular deep learning-based system was developed to predict gaze targets: head detection, region detection, and a Customized Spatio-Temporal Gaze Detection module (C-STGD). The model was trained on EMBOA-Gaze, achieving an AUC of 0.85 for point-level coordinate prediction and 75% accuracy in classifying gaze targets into semantic regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Deep Learning; Gaze Behavior; Gaze Detection; Human-Robot Interaction; Robot-Assisted Therapy","Behavioral research; Classification (of information); Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Man machine systems; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Deep learning; Gaze analysis; Gaze behaviours; Gaze detection; Humans-robot interactions; Nonverbal cues; Robot-assisted therapies; Social engagement","","","Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Baltrušaitis, Tadas, OpenFace 2.0: Facial behavior analysis toolkit, pp. 59-66, (2018); Brienza, Michele, HRI-based Gaze-contingent Eye Tracking for Autism Spectrum Disorder Treatment: A preliminary study using a NAO robot, IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication, RO-MAN, pp. 2665-2670, (2023); Cai, Haibin, Sensing-enhanced therapy system for assessing children with autism spectrum disorders: A feasibility study, IEEE Sensors Journal, 19, 4, pp. 1508-1518, (2019); Chong, Eunji, Detecting attended visual targets in video, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5395-5405, (2020); Dickstein-Fischer, Laurie A., Interactive tracking for robot-assisted autism therapy, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, pp. 107-108, (2017); Feng, Huanghao, Can NAO robot improve eye-gaze attention of children with high functioning autism?, (2013); Mediapipe, (2023); Hadjikhani, N., Look me in the eyes: Constraining gaze in the eye-region provokes abnormally high subcortical activation in autism, Scientific Reports, 7, 1, (2017); Hodges, Holly, Autism spectrum disorder: Definition, epidemiology, causes, and clinical evaluation, Translational Pediatrics, 9, pp. S55-S65, (2020)","Spencer, S.N.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGGRAPH; et al.; RealEye; Reality Labs Research; Tobii","17th ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications, ETRA 2025","","Tokyo","209510","","9798400714870","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008493175"

Specifically, the needs of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) seem to align perfectly with ICT, especially with Pedagogical Robotics, as it enables the creation of predictable and controllable environments. For this reason, the main aim of this research has been to apply the Bee-Bot robot to improve the social-emotional reciprocity responses of students with ASD. Therefore, a quantitative research based on a quasi-experimental methodology and a pre-test-post-test design has been developed. The sample of participants was composed by 22 children with ASD. In this sense, the experimental group was composed by 11 students who developed the activities through the mediation of the Bee-Bot robot. While the control group was composed by 11 other students who developed non-robotics mediated activities. An ad hoc instrument consisting of 44 items divided into three dimensions, related to the communication and social interaction area, was used. Each participant participated in ten individual sessions lasting fifteen minutes. The results indicate improvements in the post-test because of the use of robotics as a mediating learning tool. For example, there are improvements in items 1 and 2 related to attention with p values less than 0.05, as well as improvements in items 13, 15 and 16 related to the identification and discrimination of emotions. Furthermore, the results of the intra-group analysis show, on the one hand, significant differences on the part of the control group in item 13, related to emotion identification and discrimination skills. On the other hand, in the case of the experimental group, the number of items in which there are significant differences is greater. Specifically, participants in the experimental group show significant differences in items related to attention, basic social skills, conversational skills and emotion identification skills. In conclusion, the Bee-Bot robot, accompanied by a pedagogical programme, has potential for learning social-emotional reciprocity skills in these students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism spectrum disorder; Bee-Bot; Educational intervention; Robotics; Social reciprocity skills","Diseases; Economic and social effects; Robots; Spectrum analysis; Autism spectrum disorders; Bee-bot; Children with autisms; Control groups; Educational intervention; Emotion identifications; Experimental groups; Information and Communication Technologies; Post test; Social reciprocity skill; Students","","","Lorenzo-Lledó, Gonzalo G., Action protocol for the use of robotics in students with Autism Spectrum Disoders: A systematic-review, Education and Information Technologies, 26, 4, pp. 4111-4126, (2021); Rusc, (2010); Pennisi, Paola, Autism and social robotics: A systematic review, Autism Research, 9, 2, pp. 165-183, (2016); Josman, Naomi, Effectiveness of virtual reality for teaching street-crossing skills to children and adolescents with autism, International Journal on Disability and Human Development, 7, 1, pp. 49-56, (2008); Grossard, Charline, ICT and autism care: State of the art, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, 31, 6, pp. 474-483, (2018); We have the Technology Using ICT to Enhance Primary Languages, (2007); Innoeduca International Journal of Technology and Educational Innovation, (2021); Journal of Technology in Education and Learning, (2013); Revista Innoeduca International Journal of Technology and Educational Innovation, (2020); Blackley, Susan Ellen, The next chapter in the STEM education narrative: Using robotics to support programming and coding, Australian Journal of Teacher Education, 44, 4, pp. 51-64, (2019)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18754791; 18754805","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185133683"

Traditional teaching methods often fail to address the unique cognitive challenges faced by students with dyscalculia, highlighting the need for innovative educational approaches. Recent studies suggest that educational robotics and game-based learning can provide engaging and adaptive learning environments, enhancing numerical cognition and motivation in students with mathematical difficulties. The intervention was designed to improve calculation skills, problem-solving strategies, and overall engagement in mathematics. The study involved 73 secondary students, divided into three classes, among whom only a specific group had been diagnosed with dyscalculia. Data were collected through pre- and post-intervention assessment evaluating improvements in numerical accuracy, processing speed, and support motivation. Preliminary findings indicate that robotics and gamification create an interactive, less anxiety-inducing learning experience, facilitating conceptual understanding and retention of mathematical concepts. The results suggest that these tools hold promise as supplementary interventions for children with dyscalculia. Future research should explore long-term effects, optimal implementation strategies, and their integration within formal educational settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dyscalculia; educational robotics; game-based learning; mathematical interventions","Algebra; Numerical methods; Students; Academic performance; Dyscalculium; Educational game; Educational robotics; Game-Based; Game-based Learning; Mathematical intervention; Pilot studies; Problem solving skills; Specific learning; Educational robots","","","McCloskey, Michael E., Cognitive mechanisms in numerical processing: Evidence from acquired dyscalculia, Cognition, 44, 1-2, pp. 107-157, (1992); Decarli, Gisella, Severe Developmental Dyscalculia Is Characterized by Core Deficits in Both Symbolic and Nonsymbolic Number Sense, Psychological Science, 34, 1, pp. 8-21, (2023); Molko, Nicolas, Functional and structural alterations of the intraparietal sulcus in a developmental dyscalculia of genetic origin, Neuron, 40, 4, pp. 847-858, (2003); Kwok, Fuyu, Developmental dyscalculia is not associated with atypical brain activation: A univariate fMRI study of arithmetic, magnitude processing, and visuospatial working memory, Human Brain Mapping, 44, 18, pp. 6308-6325, (2023); East Afr J Educ Stud, (2023); Wakeman, Holly N., Mathematics Difficulties and Psychopathology in School-Age Children, Journal of Learning Disabilities, 56, 2, pp. 116-131, (2023); Rubinsten, Orly, Mathematics anxiety in children with developmental dyscalculia, Behavioral and Brain Functions, 6, (2010); Elem Sch J Pendidik Dan Pembelajaran Ke SD an, (2023); Mohd Syah, Nor Elleeiana, Development of computer play pedagogy intervention for children with low conceptual understanding in basic mathematics operation using the dyscalculia feature approach, Interactive Learning Environments, 24, 7, pp. 1477-1496, (2016); Stewart, William H., Exploring Factors That Influence Computational Thinking Skills in Elementary Students’ Collaborative Robotics, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 59, 6, pp. 1208-1239, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2073431X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006931762"

This study presents the design and preliminary evaluation of JARI, a social robot developed to support emotional recognition and interaction in children with ASD aged 6 to 8 years. The robot integrates mechanical, electronic, and software components within a modular architecture and is operated via a web-based Wizard of Oz interface. Aesthetic decisions, including a deliberately ambiguous zoomorphic appearance to avoid triggering the recognition of specific animal forms and the use of sensory accessories, were made to increase acceptance and reduce overstimulation. JARI was tested in the following two scenarios: individual interaction at a special education center in Peru, and group interaction at an inclusive school in Spain. Results show that most children were able to identify the robot’s emotional expressions and responded positively to its color cues. Behavioral analysis revealed significant engagement through physical gestures, sustained visual attention, and emotional mirroring. These findings suggest that JARI is effective in capturing attention and eliciting meaningful interaction from children with ASD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","aesthetic; ASD; autistic children; design; emotions; Robot Children Interaction; robotic platform; social robot","","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Klin, Ami J., Defining and quantifying the social phenotype in autism, American Journal of Psychiatry, 159, 6, pp. 895-908, (2002); Scarcella, Ileana, Information and communication technologies-based interventions for children with autism spectrum conditions: a systematic review of randomized control trials from a positive technology perspective, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 14, (2023); Int J Emerg Technol Learn Ijet, (2024); Chien, Y.

Learning is no longer confined to traditional classrooms; instead, AI- driven tools are making education more personalized, interactive, and accessible to students worldwide. In an era where global migration, conflicts, and resource shortages pose serious challenges to education, AI offers innovative solutions to bridge learning gaps and ensure that quality education reaches even the most underserved communities. Additionally, today's learners-often referred to as cyber nomads-are growing up surrounded by technology, making it essential to adapt educational methods to their digital-first way of learning. AI is also proving to be a game- changer for students with special needs, such as those with autism, by offering tailored support that traditional systems struggle to provide. This chapter delves into three major areas where AI is reshaping education. First, AI-powered personalized learning systems are revolutionizing how students learn by offering adaptive platforms, AI tutors, and real- time analytics that customize education to fit individual needs. Second, AI- driven content creation and assessment are enhancing the way educational materials are developed, automating lesson planning and grading while integrating interactive experiences like gamification and AR/VR- based learning. Finally, AI- driven administrative and institutional innovations are streamlining operations in schools and universities, making tasks like enrolment, scheduling, and performance tracking more efficient, while also using predictive analytics to help students stay on track. By exploring these advancements, this chapter aligns with the book's goal of highlighting cuttingedge AI applications that are shaping the future of education. It provides insights into how AI is transforming learning at all levels-from kindergarten to higher education-and discusses its potential to create a more inclusive, efficient, and engaging educational experience. This chapter will serve as a valuable resource for educators, administrators, and technology developers looking to harness AI's power to build a smarter, more adaptable learning environment for the next generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Curricula; Education computing; Educational robots; Engineering education; Interactive computer systems; Teaching; 'current; Computing speed; High speed internet; Innovative solutions; Personalized learning systems; Quality education; Resource shortage; Smart computing; Special needs; Traditional systems; Students","","","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans, (2018); Ashley, Kevin, Reasoning with reasons in case-based comparisons, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1010, pp. 133-144, (1995); Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education Aied 2021, (2021); Nature of Learning Using Research to Inspire Practice, (2010); Journal of Educational Technology Society, (2017); Global Auction the Broken Promises of Education Jobs and Incomes, (2011); International Journal of Educational Research, (2021); Interactive Learning Environments, (2021); Eagle, Michael John, Predicting individual differences for learner modeling in intelligent tutors from previous learner activities, pp. 55-63, (2016); Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Learning Teaching and Education Policies for the Future, (2020)","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9798369389850; 9798369389874","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004784662"

Collaborative work allows them to use and develop their nonverbal communication abilities. Therefore, we developed a collaborative work training program for individuals with ASD. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the proposed intervention for both verbal and nonverbal communication. A single humanoid robot was operated by two people, with each person operating different parts of the robot: one person moved the right half of the body while the other moved the left. The participants’ roles were separated to promote verbal and nonverbal communication. Fourteen individuals (aged 18–27 years) participated in a training experiment that was conducted once a week for a maximum of seven sessions over two months. A comparison of the amount of communication between the first and last training sessions showed that both verbal and nonverbal communication increased (p=0.044 and p=0.024, respectively), indicating that the proposed training facilitated both verbal and nonverbal communication. Future studies are needed to establish evidence supporting the generalizability of the acquired skills to daily life activities by considering longitudinal designs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism spectrum disorder; Collaborative work; Communication; Humanoid robot","adult; Article; autism; collaborative learning; collaborative work; feasibility study; female; human; human experiment; intervention study; Likert scale; male; national adult reading test; nonverbal communication; questionnaire; verbal communication; young adult; adolescent; interpersonal communication; rehabilitation; robotics; Adolescent; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Communication; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Nonverbal Communication; Robotics; Young Adult","","","Amat, Ashwaq Zaini, Design of a Desktop Virtual Reality-Based Collaborative Activities Simulator (ViRCAS) to Support Teamwork in Workplace Settings for Autistic Adults, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 31, pp. 2184-2194, (2023); Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Auyeung, Bonnie, The autism spectrum quotient: Children's version (AQ-Child), Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, 7, pp. 1230-1240, (2008); Berland, Matthew W., Comparing Virtual and Physical Robotics Environments for Supporting Complex Systems and Computational Thinking, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 24, 5, pp. 628-647, (2015); Bishop, Somer L., The autism diagnosis in translation: Shared affect in children and mouse models of ASD, Autism Research, 4, 5, pp. 317-335, (2011); Behavior Analysis in Practice, (2021); Society Integration Education Proceedings of the International Scientific Conference, (2018); Cakir, Janet, The lifetime social cost of autism: 1990–2029, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 72, (2020); Chevallier, Coralie, The social motivation theory of autism, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 16, 4, pp. 231-239, (2012); Demetriadis, Stavros N., Robot programming and tangible interfaces for cognitive training, pp. 196-223, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18762026; 18762018","","","40081085","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000563160"

SASRs have demonstrated potential in alleviating depression, loneliness, anxiety, and stress, while also improving sleep and cognitive function. Despite these promising outcomes, challenges remain in identifying the most effective interventions, refining robot designs, and evaluating long-term impacts. User acceptance hinges on trustworthiness and empathy-driven design. Compared to earlier review studies, recent research emphasizes the ongoing significance of emotional engagement, the refinement of robot functionalities, and the need to address ethical issues such as privacy and autonomy through robust cybersecurity and data privacy measures. The field is gradually shifting towards a user-centered design approach, focusing on robots as tools to augment, rather than replace, human care. While SASRs offer substantial benefits for emotional well-being and therapeutic support, further research is crucial to enhance their effectiveness and address concerns about replacing human care. Algorethics (AI ethics), interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardization and training emerge as key priorities to ensure the responsible and sustainable deployment of SASRs in healthcare settings, reinforcing the importance of rigorous methodologies and ethical safeguards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; assistance robot; assistive robot; ethics; healthcare applications; social robot; user acceptance","Diseases; Philosophical aspects; Assistance robot; Assistive; Assistive robots; Cognitive functions; Health care application; Older adults; Social robots; Systematic Review; Users' acceptance; Well being","","","Giansanti, Daniele, The social robot in rehabilitation and assistance: what is the future?, Healthcare (Switzerland), 9, 3, (2021); Deusdad, Blanca A., Ethical implications in using robots among older adults living with dementia, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 15, (2024); Dautenhahn, Kerstin, Towards interactive robots in autism therapy: Background, motivation and challenges, Pragmatics and Cognition, 12, 1, pp. 1-35, (2004); Int J Hum Comput Stud, (2007); Wada, Kazuyoshi, Living with seal robots - Its sociopsychological and physiological influences on the elderly at a care house, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 23, 5, pp. 972-980, (2007); Aymerich-Franch, Laura, Liaison, safeguard, and well-being: Analyzing the role of social robots during the COVID-19 pandemic, Technology in Society, 70, (2022); Ţǎpuş, Adriana, Socially assistive robotics [Grand challenges of robotics], IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 14, 1, pp. 35-42, (2007); Feil-Seifer, David J., Defining socially assistive robotics, 2005, pp. 465-468, (2005); Cruces, Alejandro S., Socially Assistive Robots in Smart Environments to Attend Elderly People—A Survey, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2024); Simeoni, Rossella, The social robot and the digital physiotherapist: Are we ready for the team play?, Healthcare (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002277803"

This type of play, where a child uses an object to represent other objects, is a milestone in a child's cognitive development and is often atypical in ASC. Thanks to inner electronics and a Machine Learning algorithm, Echo - which is designed with a neutral shape - can autonomously categorise the way the child handles it (in our case, moving the device on the floor like a car or swinging it through the air like an aeroplane). The device ""behaves"" as the imagined object, by emitting coherent sounds and a specific colour, arbitrarily chosen to augment the distinctiveness between toys. In a feasibility test run by the developers, we show how the prototype can process in real-time the user's gestural input, collected through an embedded accelerometer. Results show that the device categorises the correct toy identity with a performance close to 82.2% across the trained classes. We then propose, as a future work, to test Echo with ASC participants, to evaluate the toy effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assistive Technology; Autism Spectrum Conditions; Interaction Design; Machine Learning; Symbolic Play","Toy manufacture; Assistive technology; Atypicals; Autism spectrum condition; Children with autisms; Cognitive development; Condition; Interaction design; Machine-learning; Spectra's; Symbolic play; Intelligent robots","","","Abid, Mahdi, Walking Gait Step Length Asymmetry Induced by Handheld Device, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 25, 11, pp. 2075-2083, (2017); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Bai, Zhen, Exploring expressive augmented reality: The fing AR puppet system for social pretend play, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2015-April, pp. 1035-1044, (2015); Bai, Zhen, Using augmented reality to elicit pretend play for children with autism, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 21, 5, pp. 598-610, (2015); Baxter, Amanda J., The epidemiology and global burden of autism spectrum disorders, Psychological Medicine, 45, 3, pp. 601-613, (2015); Bondioli, Mariasole, Towards motor-based early detection of autism red flags: Enabling technology and exploratory study protocol, Sensors, 21, 6, pp. 1-15, (2021); Bremner, Louisa, Using game based technology as a mediating function in interventions to develop pretend play skills in children with autism spectrum disorder, Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning, 2019-October, pp. 846-853, (2019); Burns-Nader, Sherwood, The role of shape and specificity in young children's object substitution, Infant and Child Development, 28, 2, (2019); Casado, Fernando E., Walking recognition in mobile devices, Sensors, 20, 4, (2020); Davis, Jac T.M., How Large Are Gender Differences in Toy Preferences?

Although smart wearable devices (SWDs) have gained attention as possible instruments for enhancing health outcomes in this population, it is still uncertain how useful and long-lasting they will be. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to methodically evaluate the advancement of academic research and development concerning SWDs for the aged, with an emphasis on the effects these diseases have on quality of life, illness prevention, and health management. Method: 649 publications published in the Web of Science Core Collection between 2013 and 2023 underwent bibliometric analysis. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used to assess topic changes, publishing trends, and citation patterns. Co-citation analysis was used to pinpoint important literature and research focus clusters. Results: The results show a notable rise in publications about SWDs for the aged, emphasising essential topics, including fall detection, technology adoption, and healthcare applications. According to the report, multidisciplinary research integration is expanding, and publications like IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL and SENSORS-BASEL are making significant contributions. Conclusion: The research emphasises the crucial need to conduct long-term monitoring studies to verify the health advantages of SWDs for senior citizens. It highlights the necessity for user-centred design and urges future research to concentrate on improving wearable technology accuracy to maximise its usefulness in managing geriatric health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bibliometrics; elderly; health; healthcare; smart wearable devices; smartwatch and elderly care; visual analysis","accident prevention; aged; aging; Article; artificial intelligence; assistive technology; atrial fibrillation; bibliometrics; biomechanics; communication technology; consumer; convolutional neural network; daily life activity; deep learning; dementia; digital health; early diagnosis; elderly care; falling; frailty; gait; geriatric care; geriatric patient; health care management; health outcome; heart rate; hip fracture; human; information technology; interdisciplinary research; internet of things; knowledge base; long short term memory network; machine learning; medical literature; medical research; medical technology; methodology; mild cognitive impairment; monitoring; Montreal cognitive assessment; multidisciplinary care; physical activity; publication; quality of life; rehabilitation care; robotics; smart home; software; telehealth; telemonitoring; trend study; usability; user-centered design; wearable technology; physiology; prevention and control; wearable computer; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aging; Bibliometrics; Humans; Quality of Life; Wearable Electronic Devices","","","undefined, (2022); Shi, Xiaoming, Key public health challenges of the Chinese elderly in a new situation, National Medical Journal of China, 101, 44, pp. 3613-3619, (2021); Rahman, Md Shahidur, Health care in aged population:A global public health challenge, Journal of Medicine (Bangladesh), 20, 2, pp. 95-97, (2019); Senior, Tim P., Ageing meets unequal population, British Journal of General Practice, 67, 661, (2017); Palha, Pedro Fredemir, For a comprehensive health system, Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem, 23, 2, pp. 181-182, (2015); Ageing 4 0 Towards an Integrated Life Course Approach to Population Ageing, (2018); Wearable Devices and Low Power Design for Smart Health Applications Challenges and Opportunities, (2021); Klebbe, Robert, Wearables for older adults: Requirements, design, and user experience, pp. 313-332, (2019); Rattanawiboonsom, Vichayanan, Enhancing Health Monitoring and Active Aging in the Elderly Population: A Study on Wearable Technology and Technology-Assisted Care, International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 19, 11, pp. 173-186, (2023); Application of Wearables in Healthcare Management Recent Trends and Futuristic Approach, (2023)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","18787401; 09287329","","THCAE","40105159","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001451040"

However, their feasibility in general educational environments needs further exploration. This scoping review provides a critical examination of robot-based learning experiences involving children with disabilities, implemented either in mainstream schools or in specialized centers in order to gain insight into their potential to support inclusion. For this purpose, a search was conducted in the multidisciplinary Scopus and WoS databases, completed with Dialnet database. Based on PRISMA guidelines for literature reviews, we limited the systematic analysis to 33 papers published after 2009 that contain information on the instructional design and details of how the activities were implemented. On the other hand, studies reporting interventions with robots for clinical purposes were excluded as well as papers focused exclusively on technical developments. Content analysis shows that most experiences lead to improvements in terms of educational goals and/or stakeholders’ satisfaction. However, the analysis also reported issues that may hinder the adoption of these practices in general classrooms and integrated education services. The reported difficulties include the lack of stability and autonomy of the robots used, the need for aids and adaptations to enable children with sensory and physical impairments to interact easily with the robots, and the requirement of technical support with system’s setup, implementation and maintenance. We conclude that robots and robotics are a powerful tool to address the needs of diverse learners who are included in mainstream classrooms. This review aims at presenting evidences of good practices and recommendations for successful implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children with disabilities; Child–robot interaction; Educational robots; Inclusive education; Robot-based activities","Child-robot interactions; Children with disabilities; Developmental disability; Educational environment; Inclusive education; Learning disabilities; Learning experiences; Robot-based activity; Robot-based learning; Scoping review; Educational robots","","","Inclusive Education the Way of the Future, (2008); Journal of Technology in Education and Learning, (2013); Benitti, Fabiane Barreto Vavassori, Exploring the educational potential of robotics in schools: A systematic review, Computers and Education, 58, 3, pp. 978-988, (2012); Baltic Journal of Modern Computing, (2017); Xia, Liying, A systematic review on teaching and learning robotics content knowledge in K-12, Computers and Education, 127, pp. 267-282, (2018); Robots for Kids Exploring New Technologies for Learning, (2000); Research Society and Development, (2021); Tlili, Ahmed, A systematic review on robot-assisted special education from the activity theory perspective, Educational Technology and Society, 23, 3, pp. 95-109, (2020); Pliasa, Sofia, Can children of typical development benefit from inclusion intervention with Daisy Robot-a socially assistive robot?, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 235-240, (2020); Themes in Science and Technology Education, (2013)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","16155297; 16155289","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001091358"

The main objective of this study is the analysis of the effectiveness of interventions directed to enhance emotional recognition and emotional regulation among this specific population. A systematic review was carried out in databases such as Psycinfo, WoS, SCOPUS, and PubMed, identifying a total of 572 articles, of which 29 met the inclusion criteria. The total sample included 1061 participants, mainly children aged between 4 and 13 years. The analyzed interventions focused on improving emotional recognition, with significant results in the identification of emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger, although some showed limitations in the duration of these effects. The most used programs included training in facial recognition, virtual reality, and the use of new technologies such as robots. These showed improvements in both emotional recognition and social skills. Other types of interventions such as music therapy or the use of drama techniques were also implemented. However, a gender bias and lack of consistency between results from different cultures were observed. The conclusions indicate that, although the interventions reviewed seem effective, more research is needed to maximize their impact on the ASD population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorder; emotional intelligence; emotional recognition ability; emotional regulation","","","","Tendencias Pedagogicas, (2017); Revista De La Facultad De Medicina Mexico, (2022); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (1987); Dsm IV TR Manual Diagnostico Y Estadistico De Los Trastornos Mentales, (2025); Emotional Intelligence in Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum Results from the Mayer Salovey Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, (2015); Antshel, Kevin M., Autism Spectrum Disorders and ADHD: Overlapping Phenomenology, Diagnostic Issues, and Treatment Considerations, Current Psychiatry Reports, 21, 5, (2019); Bar-On, Reuven, The Bar-On model of emotional-social intelligence (ESI), Psicothema, 18, SUPPL.1, pp. 13-25, (2006); British Journal of Developmental Psychology, (1995); Educacion Y Salud Boletin Cientifico De Ciencias De La Salud Del Icsa, (2019); Beall, Paula M., Rapid facial reactions to emotional facial expressions in typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 101, 3, pp. 206-223, (2008)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22549625; 21748144","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000789851"

One of the most common goals of rehabilitation is the treatment of gait disorders. Ataxic gait disorder tends to worsen in the adolescent period. Research indicates a positive therapeutic effect of the combined application of conventional rehabilitation, robotic neurorehabilitation (RNR) and virtual reality, but there is no consensus on the length of treatment and frequency of application. The aim of this case report was to contribute to the definition of the RNR protocol for the treatment of ataxic gait disorder in adolescents with CP. Case report: In a female child with an ataxic form of CP who was on regular conventional kinesitherapy in the age period between 13 to 15 years, robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) was applied for the treatment of gait disorders. The rehabilitation protocol lasted 10 weeks, 5 times a week, and included individual, conventional kinesitherapy for 30 min and RAGT for 30 min. Combined RNR treatment was conducted once a year in the period between July and September. The results of the therapeutic evaluation revealed that the functional motor level remained unchanged, while the improved functional motor status for the category of standing and gait was maintained during treatment between the patient’s 13 and 15 years age. In their 15th year, independent gait over a shorter distance (14 m) was achieved, as well as a normal gait frequency (83 steps/minute), with a desirable duration of the left leg support phase of 65% and 70% for the right leg support phase. Conclusions: The results of our research indicate that the application of conventional kinesitherapy and RAGT, over the period of 10 weeks a year, can have a positive effect on improving the postural and locomotor functions of ataxic gait in adolescents with CP. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cerebral palsy; children; gait; motor function; rehabilitation; robotic-assisted gait training","adolescent; Apgar score; Article; ataxia; ataxic gait; brain ventricle dilatation; case report; cerebral palsy; clinical article; cognitive defect; exercise; fear of falling; female; gait; gait disorder; Gross Motor Function Classification System; Gross Motor Function Measure; human; hypoplasia; kinesiotherapy; motor performance; muscle hypotonia; muscle training; neurorehabilitation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; rehabilitation protocol; robotics; standing; stretching exercise; visual feedback","","","Rosenbaum, Peter L., A report: The definition and classification of cerebral palsy April 2006, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 49, SUPPL. 2, pp. 8-14, (2007); Himmelmann, Kate M.E., The panorama of cerebral palsy in Sweden part XII shows that patterns changed in the birth years 2007–2010, Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics, 107, 3, pp. 462-468, (2018); Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe Development of the Jrc Scpe Central Database and Public Health Indicators, (2017); Castelli, Enrico, Recommendations for the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy, European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, 52, 5, pp. 691-703, (2016); Makris, Tina, Quality of life in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy: a systematic review with meta-analysis, Disability and Rehabilitation, 43, 3, pp. 299-308, (2021); Boyer, Elizabeth R., Gait pathology subtypes are not associated with self-reported fall frequency in children with cerebral palsy, Gait and Posture, 63, pp. 189-194, (2018); Ammann-Reiffer, Corinne, Walking activities beyond gait training: Priorities in everyday life for parents and adolescents in pediatric neurorehabilitation, Journal of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, 15, 2, pp. 311-321, (2022); Marin-Medina, Daniel Stiven, New approaches to recovery after stroke, Neurological Sciences, 45, 1, pp. 55-63, (2024); Castelli, Enrico, THE ROLE OF ROBOTIC REHABILITATION IN CHILDREN WITH NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS, Psychiatria Danubina, 33, pp. S49-S51, (2021); Conner, Benjamin C., Is robotic gait training effective for individuals with cerebral palsy?

This decline impairs memory, attention, and Theory of Mind (ToM). Early intervention is crucial, and assistive robotics has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological approach in this regard. This preliminary study evaluated the acceptability of the social robot Pepper and tested the structured cognitive and socio-cognitive training delivered by the robot. Nine participants, aged 68–93, ranging from mild to moderate dementia, were engaged in a four-week training program. A qualitative analysis of the interviews and video recordings of the training sessions was conducted. Results showed high participant engagement, increased autonomy and focus, and positive emotional responses. These data are promising in demonstrating structured training implemented in social robots has the potential to positively impact cognitive function and emotional well-being through structured training. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cognitive and socio-cognitive training; Cognitive decline; Elderly intervention; Social competence; Social robots; Theory of Mind (ToM)","aged; Article; clinical article; cognition; cognitive rehabilitation; communication skill; daily life activity; degenerative disease; emotion; emotional intelligence; female; human; memory; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological assessment; qualitative analysis; robotics; semi structured interview; social competence; thematic analysis; theory of mind; verbal communication; cognitive defect; dementia; male; physiology; therapy; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Female; Humans; Male; Robotics; Social Skills; Theory of Mind","","","undefined, (2013); Birks, Melanie J., Robotic Seals as Therapeutic Tools in an Aged Care Facility: A Qualitative Study, Journal of Aging Research, 2016, (2016); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Journal of Neurology and Neuroscience, (2016); Riabilitare Le Funzioni Cognitive, (2012); d’Arma, Alessia, A cultural training for the improvement of cognitive and affective Theory of Mind in people with Multiple Sclerosis: a pilot randomized controlled study, Frontiers in Psychology, 14, (2023); Figliano, Giusi, Ageing society and the challenge for social robotics: A systematic review of Socially Assistive Robotics for MCI patients, PLOS ONE, 18, 11 November, (2023); undefined, (2014); Heitmueller, Axel, Developing public policy to advance the use of big data in health care, Health Affairs, 33, 9, pp. 1523-1530, (2014); Irving, G., The validity of some cognitive tests in the diagnosis of dementia., British Journal of Psychiatry, 117, 537, pp. 149-156, (1970)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18762026; 18762018","","","39892296","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216564109"

Thanks to its customization potential, Rehabilitation Robotics is becoming an essential area of Robotics for Medicine and Healthcare. This work concerns the design of a human-robot interaction module for gravity compensation to be used in robot-assisted rehabilitation of the hand and upper limb. The proposed module is designed to be connected, on one side, to a collaborative manipulator as an end-effector and, on the other side, to the patient’s forearm. The aim is to compensate for upper limb gravity during rehabilitation exercises while ensuring complete freedom of movement in the three-dimensional operating space. The perspective is to use the proposed solution as an enabling technology for more in-depth and targeted rehabilitation sessions once coupled with proper user-centred control strategies for the manipulator. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Brogi, Chiara, An original hybrid-architecture finger mechanism for wearable hand exoskeletons, Mechatronics, 98, (2024); Bartalucci, Lorenzo, An original mechatronic design of a kinaesthetic hand exoskeleton for virtual reality-based applications, Mechatronics, 90, (2023); Rehmat, Naqash, Upper limb rehabilitation using robotic exoskeleton systems: a systematic review, International Journal of Intelligent Robotics and Applications, 2, 3, pp. 283-295, (2018); Bertani, Rachele, Effects of robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis, Neurological Sciences, 38, 9, pp. 1561-1569, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21953570; 21953562","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000554000"

This paper presents a transformative Robot-Enhanced Therapy (RET) framework, leveraging an intricate amalgamation of an Adaptive Boosted 3D biomarker approach and Saliency Maps generated through Kernel Density Estimation. By seamlessly integrating these methodologies through majority voting, the framework pioneers a new frontier in automating the assessment of ASD levels and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency. Drawing upon the rich tapestry of the DREAM Dataset, encompassing data from 61 children, this study meticulously crafts novel features derived from diverse modalities including body skeleton, head movement, and eye gaze data. Our 3D bio-marker approach achieves a remarkable predictive prowess, boasting a staggering 95.59% accuracy and an F1 score of 92.75% for ASD level prediction, alongside an RMSE of 1.78 and an R-squared value of 0.74 for ADOS score prediction. Furthermore, the introduction of a pioneering saliency map generation method, harnessing gaze data, further enhances predictive models, elevating ASD level prediction accuracy to an impressive 97.36%, with a corresponding F1 score of 95.56%. Beyond technical achievements, this study underscores RET's transformative potential in reshaping ASD intervention paradigms, offering a promising alternative to Standard Human Therapy (SHT) by mitigating therapist variability and providing scalable therapeutic approaches. While acknowledging limitations in the research, such as sample constraints and model generalizability, our findings underscore RET's capacity to revolutionize ASD management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; Autism; diagnosis; eye gaze; skeleton joint position","Arthroplasty; Diagnosis; Musculoskeletal system; Robot learning; Robotic surgery; Autism; Autism spectrum disorders; Disorder levels; Ensemble learning; Eye-gaze; F1 scores; Multi-modal; Saliency map; Skeleton joint position; Skeleton joints; Diseases; biological marker; accuracy; Article; artificial intelligence; Asperger syndrome; autism; autism assessment; child; conceptual framework; consistent robot enhanced therapy framework; controlled study; deep neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; ensemble learning; head movement; human; learning algorithm; major clinical study; measurement accuracy; multimodal imaging; participation; support vector machine; algorithm; diagnosis; eye fixation; female; machine learning; male; physiology; preschool child; robotics; Algorithms; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Biomarkers; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Head Movements; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Robotics","","Biomarkers","Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2019); Hossain, Mohammad Didar, Autism Spectrum disorders (ASD) in South Asia: A systematic review, BMC Psychiatry, 17, 1, (2017); Meilleur, Andrée Anne S., Prevalence of Clinically and Empirically Defined Talents and Strengths in Autism, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45, 5, pp. 1354-1367, (2015); Maenner, Matthew J., Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2020, MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 72, 2, (2023); Mahajan, Rajneesh, Clinical practice pathways for evaluation and medication choice for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in autism spectrum disorders, Pediatrics, 130, SUPPL. 2, pp. S125-S138, (2012); Murray, Michael J., Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the context of autism spectrum disorders, Current Psychiatry Reports, 12, 5, pp. 382-388, (2010); Gadow, Kenneth D., ADHD symptom subtypes in children with pervasive developmental disorder, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 36, 2, pp. 271-283, (2006); Antshel, Kevin M., Autism Spectrum Disorders and ADHD: Overlapping Phenomenology, Diagnostic Issues, and Treatment Considerations, Current Psychiatry Reports, 21, 5, (2019); Corbett, Blythe A., Autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Assessing attention and response control with the integrated visual and auditory continuous performance test, Child Neuropsychology, 12, 4-5, pp. 335-348, (2006); Sturm, Harald, Autism spectrum disorders in children with normal intellectual levels: Associated impairments and subgroups, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 46, 7, pp. 444-447, (2004)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15580210; 15344320","","ITNSB","40031756","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000134127"

Dementia, an irreversible disease, is characterized by progressive deterioration in cognitive domains such as complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor skills, and social cognition. The DSM-5 includes social cognition as a new category under neurocognitive disorders (NCD), highlighting the significant impact of social interaction on cognitive health and the increased risk of dementia associated with social isolation. As the demand for care increases, human-robot interaction (HRI) is expected to become more prevalent in various settings, including hospitals, communities, and homes. This systematic review examines fifteen studies published over the past decade to identify strategies for improving social interaction interventions for elderly individuals with MCI using HRI. The review provides an overview of the human-robot social interaction experience and explores methods to enhance (1) robot usability through individual and design factors, (2) intention to use robots by addressing acceptability and utility, and (3) level of engagement by considering interest, interaction tools, and preparation for interacting with robots. The review concludes by discussing the barriers that affect HRI and providing recommendations for future research to optimize the potential of HRI in supporting the cognitive and social well-being of elderly individuals with MCI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cognitive Training; Human-robot Interaction; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Systematic Review","Neurodegenerative diseases; Aging population; Cognitive domain; Cognitive impairment; Cognitive training; Condition; Humans-robot interactions; Mild cognitive impairment; Social cognition; Social interactions; Systematic Review; Social robots","","","Hwang, Jongnam, Effects of participation in social activities on cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults in Korea, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 10, (2018); Chepenik, Lara Gayle, The Influence of Sad Mood on Cognition, Emotion, 7, 4, pp. 802-811, (2007); Wilson, Robert S., Negative social interactions and risk of mild cognitive impairment in old age, Neuropsychology, 29, 4, pp. 561-570, (2015); Łukasik, S., The role of socially assistive robots in the care of older people: To assist in cognitive training, to remind or to accompany?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 18, (2021); Agrigoroaie, Roxana M., Developing a healthcare robot with personalized behaviors and social skills for the elderly, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, 2016-April, pp. 589-590, (2016); Arevalo-Rodriguez, Ingrid, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the early detection of dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2021, 7, (2021); Chen, Shuchuan, Can the Paro be my Buddy?

To clarify this, we conducted a systematic literature review focused on interventions and strategies in STEM and STEAM education for SWDs based on 263 studies retrieved from the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science (WoS), and ERIC from 2013–2024. The studies cover proposals from early childhood to tertiary education. After the screening and appraisal stages, 39 interventions with 21 strategies were identified. The outcomes mostly reveal the following: (1) The studies are mainly focused on the U.S. and in students with autism, learning disabilities, or behavioral disorders between low and medium severity levels. (2) Interventions for autistic students use robotics and coding to foster cognitive, social, and communicative skills. (3) Interventions for deaf or hard-of-hearing students focus on creating a science identity and the issues with non-standardized STEM concepts in American sign language (ASL); in contrast, visually impaired students focus on assistive technologies and the accessibility of educational materials. (4) Little attention has been paid to other disabilities apart from autism, intellectual or learning ones, as well as the perspective of educators to support SWDs in classrooms. And (5) New machine learning, metaverse, and AI models are being used to assess the cognitive-emotional states of the SWDs. The conclusions and insights derived from this study can help educators and researchers to create new methodologies or strategies that sustain SWDs in STEM-STEAM education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inclusion; STEAM education; STEM education; Students with disabilities; Systematic literature review","","","","Journal of Science Education for Students with Disabilities, (2020); Aguilera, David, Stem vs. Steam education and student creativity: A systematic literature review, Education Sciences, 11, 7, (2021); Amor, A.

Traditional intervention approaches typically require support under the direct supervision of well-trained professionals. However, teaching and training programs for children with ASD can also be enhanced by assistive technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Methods: In this study, we examined whether robotics can improve the imitation skills of children with autism and support therapists during therapeutic sessions. We designed scenarios for training hand clapping imitation skills using the NAO robot and analyzed the interaction between children with autism and the robot. Results: We developed a deep learning approach based on the human action recognition algorithm for analyzing clapping imitation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that integrating robotics into therapeutic practices can effectively enhance the imitation skills of children with ASD, offering valuable support to therapists. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism; convolutional neural network; human action recognition; imitation; robot; therapy","algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; assistive technology; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; child; clinical article; comparative study; conceptual framework; controlled study; convolutional neural network; dancing; deep learning; exploratory research; feature extraction; feedback system; female; human; human action recognition algorithm; imitation; k nearest neighbor; language ability; learning algorithm; male; preschool child; random forest; robotics; Saudi Arabia; school child; social competence; social interaction; support vector machine; therapy effect; verbal behavior; VGG-16 model; videorecording","","","Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Desideri, Lorenzo, Using a Humanoid Robot as a Complement to Interventions for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Pilot Study, Advances in Neurodevelopmental Disorders, 2, 3, pp. 273-285, (2018); Journal of Modern Rehabilitation, (2018); Saleh, Mohammed Ahmed, Robots and autistic children: A review, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences, 8, 3, pp. 1247-1262, (2020); Chung, Eva Yin Han, Robotic Intervention Program for Enhancement of Social Engagement among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities, 31, 4, pp. 419-434, (2019); undefined; Zhang, Minyue, Virtual Reality Technology as an Educational and Intervention Tool for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Current Perspectives and Future Directions, Behavioral Sciences, 12, 5, (2022); Alabdulkareem, Amal, A Systematic Review of Research on Robot-Assisted Therapy for Children with Autism, Sensors, 22, 3, (2022); Journal of Human Robot Interaction, (2025); Wan, Guobin, FECTS: A Facial Emotion Cognition and Training System for Chinese Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20754418","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214532195"

Methods: This is a preliminary analysis involving ten healthy volunteers and two patients with shoulder musculoskeletal disorders. The protocol was developed in two phases (III and IV) with different ROM limits and including flexion–extension (FE), external-rotation (ER) and internal-rotation (IR) exercises, performed at two speeds and both with and without NAO assistance. Simultaneously, upper limb kinematics were assessed using a stereophotogrammetric system as a reference. Performance was evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE) for ROM and execution time, with smoothness assessed through Log Dimensionless Jerk analysis. Results: In phase III, results for volunteers showed ROM differences in FE and ER, while IR was unaffected by NAO presence. In phase IV, NAO assistance resulted in reduced MAE across nearly all exercises. Patients who only performed phase III exercises at lower speed stayed within ROM limits for all movements performed with NAO, except for ER. For all the participants, results showed a significant reduction in the time MAE when using NAO. Patients exhibit greater smoothness during FE performed with NAO. Conclusions: NAO showed potential in aiding patients with shoulder musculoskeletal disorders to replicate rehabilitation exercises, guiding both ROM and timing while influencing movement smoothness. NAO imitation could lead to improved rehabilitation outcomes and enhanced motor learning of motor skills, fostering greater adherence to prescribed therapy.

The study group consists of a fourth-grade student. It was discovered that the student lacked numerical and logical skills compared to other students. Despite this knowledge, no extra intervention or supporting studies were conducted with or for the student. During the preparation process, the student completed several Dyscalculia Diagnostic methods such are dyscalculia pre-assessment form, monitoring, a dyscalculia control list. In the final stage of the diagnostic process, the WISC-R IV intelligence scale was administered by a clinical psychologist. It was identified that the student had a mathematical learning disorder. Mathematical feedback forms were used for pre-tests and final tests to observe the Student’s view toward Mathematics. The student received 40 min of lessons, five days a week for seven weeks, for a total of 35 lesson sessions. The teaching sessions were supported by Web 2.0 tools (digital games), robotic coding, activity papers, Interactive Arithmetic Tablets, Interactive Numerical Tablets, and home studies. The study uses the action research method as a qualitative research approach. Observations, meetings, teacher’s diary, achievement tests, Web 2.0 and robotic coding measurement tools, and student’s notion forms were used as data gathering tools.

Innovative Human-Robot-Game (HRG) platforms are particularly promising for assessing learning and behaviour in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who often face challenges with attention, communication, and socialisation. Research shows that when children with ASD engage with social robots connected to interactive educational games, their learning, attention, and communication skills improve. This study aims to monitor the psychosocial and cognitive progress of children with ASD using an HRG platform, refining it as a tool for active learning. The article focuses on enhancing the facial recognition metrics of the HRG platform, which is identified as LOLY-MIDI and designed to measure attention and emotions in children while playing serious video games with the assistance of a social robot. Using a mixed-methods experimental approach strategy, reviewing previous studies, and employing tools like OpenFace and the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) for facial recognition, the research achieved greater precision in designing these metrics, providing accurate measurements of attention and emotional responses. The findings offer valuable insights for psychology and education professionals in assessing the socio-educational progress of children with ASD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","facial recognition; HCI; inclusive education; serious games; Special needs; video games","Adversarial machine learning; Educational robots; Intelligent robots; Robot learning; Social robots; Active Learning; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Facial recognition; Game platforms; Human robots; Inclusive education; Special needs; Video-games; Active learning","","","Aguiar, Yuska Paola Costa, AutismGuide: a usability guidelines to design software solutions for users with autism spectrum disorder, Behaviour and Information Technology, 41, 6, pp. 1132-1150, (2022); Alhakbani, Noura A., Facial Emotion Recognition-based Engagement Detection in Autism Spectrum Disorder, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 15, 3, pp. 959-967, (2024); Amukune, Stephen, Game-Based Assessment of School Readiness Domains of 3-8-year-old-children: A Scoping Review, Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 11, 1, pp. 146-167, (2022); Auliawan, Althaf Gauhar, The Usage of AI Robot in English Language Teaching for City Revitalization Case Study: Toda Daini Elementary School, Toda City, Saitama, Japan, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 436, 1, (2020); Baltrušaitis, Tadas, Cross-dataset learning and person-specific normalisation for automatic Action Unit detection, 2015-January, (2015); Baltrušaitis, Tadas, OpenFace 2.0: Facial behavior analysis toolkit, pp. 59-66, (2018); undefined, (2000); Chinchay, Yussy, Towards more supportive ICT for children with autism spectrum disorders: lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic, Behaviour and Information Technology, 43, 12, pp. 3027-3046, (2024); Drimalla, Hanna, Imitation and recognition of facial emotions in autism: a computer vision approach, Molecular Autism, 12, 1, (2021); Dubois-Sage, Marion, People with Autism Spectrum Disorder Could Interact More Easily with a Robot than with a Human: Reasons and Limits, Behavioral Sciences, 14, 2, (2024)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","0144929X; 13623001","","BEITD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211008632"

This study aimed to develop and test a robotic intervention framework for children with ASD to ensure best practice. Methods: In Phase I of this study, an initial framework was built based on a scoping review. This review aimed to identify the core elements conducive to effective robotic intervention programmes for children with ASD. In Phase II, the content of the initial framework was verified using a case study approach in a real-life setting. Results: The robotic intervention framework, which comprised three domains, was built and tested. The three domains were robot-, child-, and programme-related factors. Elements within each domain were identified and verified in real-life contexts. Conclusions: The proposed framework will enhance evidence-based practice in robotic intervention programmes. However, further clinical testing is warranted to enhance the efficacy and validity of this framework. A good programme design incorporating all essential elements for effective intervention will ensure the success of the training programme for children with ASD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assistive technology; Autism; program framework; robotics; social engagement","autism; child; human; rehabilitation; robotics; social interaction; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Humans; Robotics; Social Interaction","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Editorial Perspective Neurodiversitya Revolutionary Concept for Autism and Psychiatry, (2017); Giannopulu, Irini, Multimodal interactions in free game play of children with autism and a mobile toy robot, NeuroRehabilitation, 27, 4, pp. 305-311, (2010); Srinivasan, Sudha Madhav, Effect of interactions between a child and a robot on the imitation and praxis performance of typically Devloping children and a child with autism: A preliminary study, Perceptual and Motor Skills, 116, 3, pp. 885-904, (2013); Kim, Elizabeth S., Social robots as embedded reinforcers of social behavior in children with autism, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43, 5, pp. 1038-1049, (2013); Costa, Sandra C., Using a Humanoid Robot to Elicit Body Awareness and Appropriate Physical Interaction in Children with Autism, International Journal of Social Robotics, 7, 2, pp. 265-278, (2015); Shamsuddin, Syamimi A., Initial response in HRI-A case study on evaluation of child with Autism Spectrum Disorders interacting with a humanoid robot NAO, Procedia Engineering, 41, pp. 1448-1455, (2012); Designing A More Inclusive World, (2004); Alabdulkareem, Amal, A Systematic Review of Research on Robot-Assisted Therapy for Children with Autism, Sensors, 22, 3, (2022); Scassellati, Brian, Robots for use in autism research, Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering, 14, pp. 275-294, (2012)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","17483107; 17483115","","","39378054","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205892586"

The study rational is based on evidence for paired associated learning of visual-verbal stimuli, integrated with the use of a tangible technological device (educational floor robot) as means for promoting letter knowledge. Two intervention groups (N = 60) participated. The intervention lasted for eight sessions of phonological training; each dedicated to one target letter. Participants were asked to navigate the robot’s path from a current stopping point to the next according to phonological information processing. Both groups went through the same procedure, but using a different type of mat (one with and one without a visual form of the letter). A control group (N = 30) of at-risk preschoolers received no intervention except for their preschool educational routine. We found that children who participated in phonological training with linkage to the visual form of the letter scored higher in post-intervention tests. Among other proposed explanations, we mention the advantages of using a tangible robot and seemingly three-dimensional letters, along with the tendency to consider visual features while processing language stimulus among children with dyslexia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bee-bot; grapheme; intervention; letter naming; phoneme; visuo-verbal processing","","","","Acha, Joana, The role of letter knowledge acquisition ability on children's decoding and word identification: Evidence from an artificial orthography, Journal of Research in Reading, 46, 4, pp. 358-375, (2023); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Apelboim-Dushnitzky, Gila, Promoting emergent literacy skills among children at risk for specific learning disorder: general vs. Specific vs. Combined metacognitive interventions, European Journal of Special Needs Education, 40, 2, pp. 259-275, (2025); Asli-Badarneh, Abeer, Morphological ability among monolingual and bilingual speakers in early childhood: The case of two Semitic languages, International Journal of Bilingualism, 23, 5, pp. 1087-1105, (2019); Atman Uslu, Nilüfer, A systematic review study on educational robotics and robots, Interactive Learning Environments, 31, 9, pp. 5874-5898, (2023); Backes, Walter H., Atypical brain activation of reading processes in children with developmental dyslexia, Journal of Child Neurology, 17, 12, pp. 867-871, (2002); Computational Thinking in Prek 5 Empirical Evidence for Integration and Future Directions, (2022); OECD Education Working Papers, (2010); Brainin, Einat, Promoting Spatial Language and Ability Among SLD Children: Can Robot Programming Make a Difference?, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 60, 7, pp. 1742-1762, (2022); Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, (1997)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","07356331; 15414140","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203268281"

The system was tested on senior participants and gathered, analyzed, and displayed individual interaction models to provide automated user engagement, daily interaction monitoring, and automatic early detection of deteriorating mental health. The findings were presented using bar charts and confusion matrices, incorporating important metrics such as mental workload and speech/non-speech interaction graphic. These visualizations aided individuals in managing their behavior to achieve an optimal cognitive workload, a challenging measure to determine due to cognitive decline. In order to make significant progress in the subject, future advancements need to focus on addressing the unpredictability in human speech sequences, using non-speech modalities such as gestures or facial expressions as supplementary inputs to complement speech and behavior, and effectively managing concerns related to human rights and data protection.

Before the intervention, the children’s autism severity, verbal comprehension, and Theory of Mind skills were assessed. Each child received four 30-min training sessions over 4 weeks, during which they watched four dramas performed by human or robot actors, in which one character shared an event with another character, who then displayed an empathic response. Parents completed a questionnaire before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention, and children’s cognitive empathy (CE), affective empathy (AE), and prosocial behavior (PB) were evaluated in an experimental task. Results: Both RBI and HBI training promote empathy skills, specifically CE, AE, and PB, as evaluated through children’s verbal responses in story tasks.

ASD is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide. ASD individuals' different perception on interpersonal space (IPS) contributes to their social behavior challenges. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of 679 research artifacts, filtered and screened down to 11 relevant research papers published since 2018. After thorough analysis of these selected papers, we concluded that most of the research focused on teenagers and young adults, and presented evidence indicating a correlation between autism and altered IPS perception when compared to neurotypical individuals. We also observed that emerging technologies such as VR and robots have been used for social interaction training. Through our study, it became clear that IPS in individuals with ASD is a less researched field, especially for adults and elderly within a large sample size. The significance of our literature review is underscored by the context of COVID-19 social isolation and Generation Z's heavy reliance on digital communication, all of which exacerbate the challenge of ASD's perception on IPS. We discussed options for future research with regards to cultural norms, gender, and urban and rural environments. This review will direct further investigations in the ASD field to foster an inclusive society. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); interpersonal space (IPS); physical space","Social behavior; Autism spectrum disorder; Autism spectrum disorders; Condition; Interpersonal space; Literature search; Physical space; Research artefacts; Social behaviour; Social communications; Space perception; Digital communication systems","","","undefined; undefined; Candini, Michela, The physiological correlates of interpersonal space, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Asada, Kosuke, Reduced personal space in individuals with Autism spectrum disorder, PLOS ONE, 11, 1, (2016); Frontiers Personal Space Increases During the Covid 19 Pandemic in Response to Real and Virtual Humans; A Tethered Generation Exploring the Role of Mobile Phones in the Daily Life of Young People Paul Mihailidis, (2014); Rubinsten, Orly, Different neural activations for an approaching friend versus stranger: Linking personal space to numerical cognition, Brain and Behavior, 10, 6, (2020); Qian, Haoyue, Representing strangers in personal space triggers coding of defensive hand movement, Neuropsychologia, 158, (2021); Sorokowska, Agnieszka, Preferred Interpersonal Distances: A Global Comparison, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 48, 4, pp. 577-592, (2017); Proxemics 101 Understanding Personal Space Across Cultures, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","15th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2025","","Princeton; NJ","212535","","9798331513436","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017666335"

Secondarily, barriers to and facilitators for the implementation of SARA in LTC were identified. Lastly, the usability of the robot was explored. Design: A qualitative design using semi-structured interviews. The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to explore the usability of the robot. Setting and participants: Seven healthcare professionals from 2 Dutch LTC organizations (one for dementia care and one for ID care) participated. Methods: Online semi-structured interviews were conducted. The SUS was completed online before the interview. Data were analyzed thematically using both an inductive and deductive approach. Results: Three themes were identified: 1) acceptance of SARA by all involved, 2) impact of SARA on all involved, and 3) user-friendliness. The acceptance of SARA among healthcare professionals grew over time. SARA may enhance job satisfaction and enjoyment. The reported impact on residents was predominantly positive. The few negative effects were seen when offered activities did not match the situation or the resident's needs. Although implementation required a time investment, healthcare professionals saw the potential of SARA to save time. Barriers to and facilitators for the implementation of SARA were identified: adequate education about working with SARA, high motivation among staff, and support from the supplier were reported as the most important facilitators. The usability was considered marginally acceptable. Participants provided recommendations to further improve SARA. Conclusions and implications: The user experiences with SARA were predominantly positive, making the robot a promising aid for healthcare professionals in delivering high-quality, personalized care in LTC. Quantitative studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of SARA. The usability of the robot may be improved by adhering to the recommendations when upgrading SARA. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dementia; healthcare professionals; intellectual disability; long-term care; Robot","","","","undefined; undefined; Yarnall, Alison Jane, New horizons in multimorbidity in older adults, Age and Ageing, 46, 6, pp. 882-888, (2017); Fong, Joelle H., Disability incidence and functional decline among older adults with major chronic diseases, BMC Geriatrics, 19, 1, (2019); undefined; Shiells, Kate R., Self-reported needs and experiences of people with dementia living in nursing homes: a scoping review, Aging and Mental Health, 24, 10, pp. 1553-1568, (2020); Cleland, Jenny, What defines quality of care for older people in aged care?

ASD is a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders that impact a person’s ability to socially interact and communicate, which can typically be noticed in early childhood. While ‘autism’ as a term was initially used for schizophrenic patients, later psychiatrists Dr. Kanner and paediatrician Dr. Asperger introduced it as a syndrome in children with behavioural differences in social interaction and communication with restrictive and repetitive interests. In today’s time, the umbrella term ‘ASDs’ is used to describe a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Purpose: To examine the role of traditional approaches and the potential effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in dealing with ASDs for improving the accuracy in its diagnosis and treatment. Methodology: The study adopts a narrative review approach to understand the application of AI in ASD. For this purpose, around a hundred research articles were selected from the years 2010–2024. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. The review is organised and grounded on the medical treatment, occupational remedy, vocational remedy, psychology, family remedy and recuperation engineering. Results and Conclusion: The results show the undisputed role of AI and its ability to identify early indicators of autism, in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Further, healthcare sectors which are using a variety of AI analyses on data sources, genetics, neuroimaging, behavioural patterns and electronic medical records are able to early detect for individualised evaluation of ASD. The significance of timely interventions with the help of machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrates high accuracy in differentiating ASD from neurotypical development and other developmental disorders. AI-driven therapeutic interventions expand social interactions and communication skills in people with ASD in the form of virtual reality-based training, augmentative communication systems and robot-assisted therapies. Thus, the future of AI in ASD holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, implementing telehealth platforms and customising treatment plans, despite obstacles such as data privacy and interpretability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; Autism spectrum disorders; machine learning; multimodal integration; repetitive behaviours; sensory sensitivity","algorithm; artificial intelligence; Asperger syndrome; augmentative communication system; autism; child; compulsion; data privacy; developmental disorder; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; electronic medical record; health care cost; human; machine learning; mental disease; neuroimaging; open access; pediatrician; psychiatrist; review; robot-assisted procedure; robot-assisted therapy; schizophrenia; social interaction; sustainable development goal; telehealth; virtual reality","","","Banna, Md Hasan Al, A Monitoring System for Patients of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Artificial Intelligence, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12241 LNAI, pp. 251-262, (2020); Webb, Sara Jane, The motivation for very early intervention for infants at high risk for autism spectrum disorders, International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 16, 1, pp. 36-42, (2014); Huerta, Marisela, Diagnostic evaluation of autism spectrum disorders, Pediatric Clinics of North America, 59, 1, pp. 103-111, (2012); Constable, Paul A., Spectral Analysis of Light-Adapted Electroretinograms in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Classification with Machine Learning, Bioengineering, 12, 1, (2025); J Asiat Soc Mumbai; Gesi, Camilla, Gender differences in misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis among adults with autism spectrum disorder with no language or intellectual disability, Brain Sciences, 11, 7, (2021); Ivanov, Hristo Y., Autism Spectrum Disorder - A Complex Genetic Disorder, Folia Medica, 57, 1, pp. 19-28, (2015); Jaliaawala, Muhammad Shoaib, Can autism be catered with artificial intelligence-assisted intervention technology?

We developed an active learning method based on reinforcement learning to personalize human-robot interaction sessions based on each child's imitation performance and preference. We evaluated this method with five children with autism spectrum disorder, and the results demonstrated varying responses to different methods of presenting facial expressions to teach imitation skills. We found that the robot consistently promoted increased shared attention, including visual contact and physical proximity during imitation tasks. This suggests that adaptive human-robot interactions can cater to the unique needs of children with autism, offering a promising avenue for personalized intervention. Additionally, we discuss observed qualitative insights from our study and considerations for robot behavior mitigation strategies to sustain engagement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Active learning; Federated learning; Intelligent robots; Man machine systems; Robot learning; Social robots; Active learning methods; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Facial Expressions; Humans-robot interactions; Individual Differences; Performance; Personalized learning; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Lord, Catherine E., Autism spectrum disorder, Nature Reviews Disease Primers, 6, 1, (2020); Green, Renée M., Women and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Diagnosis and Implications for Treatment of Adolescents and Adults, Current Psychiatry Reports, 21, 4, (2019); Rynkiewicz, Agnieszka, Girls and women with autism, Psychiatria Polska, 53, 4, pp. 737-752, (2019); Campbell Systematic Reviews, (2014); Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2011); Fountain, Christine, Six developmental trajectories characterize children with autism, Pediatrics, 129, 5, pp. e1112-e1120, (2012); Askari, Farzaneh, A Pilot Study on Facial Expression Recognition Ability of Autistic Children Using Ryan, A Rear-Projected Humanoid Robot, pp. 790-795, (2018); Feng, Huanghao, A Music-Therapy Robotic Platform for Children With Autism: A Pilot Study, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 9, (2022); Duquette, Audrey, Exploring the use of a mobile robot as an imitation agent with children with low-functioning autism, Autonomous Robots, 24, 2, pp. 147-157, (2008)","Ott, C.; Admoni, H.; Behnke, S.; Bogdan, S.; Bolopion, A.; Choi, Y.; Ficuciello, F.; Gans, N.; Gosselin, C.; Harada, K.; Kayacan, E.; Kim, H.J.; Leutenegger, S.; Liu, Z.; Maiolino, P.; Marques, L.; Matsubara, T.; Mavromatti, A.; Minor, M.; O'Kane, J.; Park, H.W.; Park, H.-W.; Rekleitis, I.; Renda, F.; Ricci, E.; Riek, L.D.; Sabattini, L.; Shen, S.; Sun, Y.; Wieber, P.-B.; Yamane, K.; Yu, J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Amazon Robotics; et al.; Flexiv; Raphe mPhibr; Symbolic; VisionNav Robotics","2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, ICRA 2025","","Atlanta; GA; Georgia World Congress Center","211973","10504729","9798331541392; 9780818634529; 9781728173955; 0818634529; 0818627204; 9781479969234; 0780365763; 9780780389144; 9781538660263; 078034300X","PIIAE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016579136"

The administration of traditional screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can be challenging for patients with communication or motor limitations. This study aimed to determine whether routinely collected functional assessments can effectively predict cognitive impairment in stroke patients undergoing robotic-assisted gait training with the Lokomat system. In this retrospective analysis, data from 274 stroke patients who received Lokomat-based rehabilitation were examined. Patients with complete data on the MMSE, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were included in the final analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score <24. Five supervised machine learning models—logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost—were developed to classify cognitive status using FMA, MBI, and TUG as predictors. The performance of each model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Logistic regression demonstrated the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.92, accuracy = 89.5%), followed by random forest (AUC = 0.88) and XGBoost (AUC = 0.87). FMA was identified as the most significant predictor in tree-based models. Patients classified as cognitively impaired exhibited significantly lower functional scores than their unimpaired counterparts (p <0.001). Functional assessments routinely performed during stroke rehabilitation can provide a practical and accurate method for identifying cognitive impairment, especially when cognitive screening is constrained. These results support the incorporation of machine learning–based tools into clinical decision-making during robotic rehabilitation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cognitive impairment; functional assessments; Lokomat-based rehabilitation; robotic-assisted gait training; supervised machine learning models","Cognitive systems; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Random forests; Robotics; Support vector regression; Areas under the curves; Cognitive impairment; Functionals; Gait training; Lokomat; Lokomat-based rehabilitation; Machine learning models; Robotic-assisted gait training; Supervised machine learning; Supervised machine learning model; Functional assessment","","","Zinn, Sandra, The effect of poststroke cognitive impairment on rehabilitation process and functional outcome, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 85, 7, pp. 1084-1090, (2004); Stolwyk, Rene John, Poststroke Cognitive Impairment Negatively Impacts Activity and Participation Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Stroke, 52, 2, pp. 748-760, (2021); Quinn, Terry J., Cognitive and mood assessment tools for use in stroke, Stroke, 49, 2, pp. 483-490, (2018); Mitchell, Alex J., The mini-mental state examination (MMSE): Update on its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility for cognitive disorders, pp. 37-48, (2016); Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore, Lokomat training in vascular dementia: motor improvement and beyond!, Aging Clinical and Experimental Research, 27, 6, pp. 935-937, (2015); Baronchelli, Federica, The Effect of Robotic Assisted Gait Training With Lokomat® on Balance Control After Stroke: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Frontiers in Neurology, 12, (2021); Hiengkaew, Vimonwan, Minimal detectable changes of the berg balance scale, fugl-meyer assessment scale, timed ""up & go"" test, gait speeds, and 2-minute walk test in individuals with chronic stroke with different degrees of ankle plantarflexor tone, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 93, 7, pp. 1201-1208, (2012); Taylor, Morag E., Neuropsychological, physical, and functional mobility measures associated with falls in cognitively impaired older adults, Journals of Gerontology - Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, 69, 8, pp. 987-995, (2014); Borges, Sheila De Melo, Correlation between functional mobility and cognitive performance in older adults with cognitive impairment, Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition, 25, 1, pp. 23-32, (2018); Galea, Mary Pauline, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): Commentary, Australian Journal of Physiotherapy, 51, 3, (2005)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015876149"

Social robots show promise in supporting both people with intellectual disabilities and their health care professionals; yet, few are fully developed and embedded in productive care environments. Implementation of such technologies is inherently complex, requiring careful examination of facilitators and barriers influencing sustained use. Objective: This research aimed to evaluate the value creation and implementation of social robots for people with intellectual disabilities and health care professionals, examining facilitators of and barriers to sustained use across 6 care organizations. Methods: A qualitative field study was conducted involving 19 cases of robot implementation across 6 care organizations in the Netherlands; each case consisted of people with intellectual disabilities (clients) and the involved health care professionals. The study examined actual robot deployment in daily care practice between April 2023 and October 2023. Semistructured interviews were conducted with health care professionals after 2 months of implementation. Analysis followed a thematic approach guided by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework and a model for tracing facilitators of and barriers to the adaptive implementation of the robot. Facilitators were classified as key drivers (complex), enablers (complicated), and minor benefits (simple), whereas barriers were categorized as deal-breakers (complex), obstacles (complicated), and minor hurdles (simple). The robots’ sustained use (ie, robot use continuance at 2 months after implementation) served as a key indicator of success. Results: After 2 months, robot use continued in 63% (12/19) of cases. For successful cases, the robot created distinct value among both clients (enhanced daily structure, improved emotional well-being through nonjudgmental interactions, and increased independence) and health care professionals (reduced workload through automation, improved quality of client interactions, and reduced emotional burden). Client characteristics (cognitive capabilities and care predictability), health care professional factors (available time and digital competency), contextual conditions (timing and connectivity), and organizational support (training and resources) influenced sustained use. Main implementation barriers included complex or unpredictable care needs, insufficient programming time, and contextual factors affecting care environments. Conclusions: The findings inform long-term care organizations on the implementation and value of the sustained use of social robots for both people with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers. Social robot Ivy demonstrates potential for supporting care delivery to people with intellectual disabilities when implemented under appropriate conditions. Success requires careful matching of robot capabilities with client needs, sufficient time and support for health care professionals, and stable care environments. Future research should examine longer-term sustainability and integrate direct client feedback. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptive implementation; adoption; assistive technology; barriers; facilitators; field study; health care innovation; implementation; intellectual disability care; social robots; technology continuance","Article; automation; emotional stress; emotional well-being; female; field study; health care delivery; health care need; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; independence; job satisfaction; male; medical education; mentally disabled person; Netherlands; patient empowerment; patient engagement; personal experience; qualitative research; scale up; semi structured interview; social interaction; thematic analysis; workload; adult; intellectual impairment; interview; middle aged; psychology; robotics; therapy; Adult; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Robotics","","","undefined; An International Comparison of Care for People with Intellectual Disabilities Scp Publication 2018 18; Torrado Vidal, Juan Carlos, Hands-On Experiences with Assistive Technologies for People with Intellectual Disabilities: Opportunities and Challenges, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 106408-106424, (2020); Boot, Fleur H., Access to assistive technology for people with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review to identify barriers and facilitators, Journal of Intellectual Disability Research, 62, 10, pp. 900-921, (2018); Asl, Aysan Mahmoudi, Potential Facilitators of and Barriers to Implementing the MINI Robot in Community-Based Meeting Centers for People With Dementia and Their Carers in the Netherlands and Spain: Explorative Qualitative Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, (2023); Huijnen, Claire A.G.J., Roles, Strengths and Challenges of Using Robots in Interventions for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 49, 1, pp. 11-21, (2019); Huijnen, Claire A.G.J., Robot KASPAR as Mediator in Making Contact with Children with Autism: A Pilot Study, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 2, pp. 237-249, (2021); Guemghar, Imane, Social Robot Interventions in Mental Health Care and Their Outcomes, Barriers, and Facilitators: Scoping Review, JMIR Mental Health, 9, 4, (2022); Hirt, Julian, Social robot interventions for people with dementia: A systematic review on effects and quality of reporting, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 79, 2, pp. 773-792, (2021); Blindheim, Kari, Promoting activity in long-term care facilities with the social robot Pepper: a pilot study, Informatics for Health and Social Care, 48, 2, pp. 181-195, (2023)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","14388871","","","40929721","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015816449"

Participants included three children, ages 5–7 years old, recruited from a public elementary school in the Northeastern United States. The study comprised two distinct conditions using an adapted alternating treatment design. First, a pre-assessment gauged participants proficiency in life skills and science vocabulary, with the aim of selecting of target sets for the intervention. In the human condition, participants engaged in two activities guided by a human instructor, while in the robot condition, they participated in two activities led by a robot instructor. Each condition had one set of life skills vocabulary and one set of science vocabulary. Finally, during the post-assessment phase, participants were re-evaluated using the vocabulary assessment and completed a social validity measure to indicate their preference for either the human or robot instructor. Two of the three children completed all conditions. Findings revealed that both participants successfully acquired all nine vocabulary words across both conditions. However, participants demonstrated faster mastery of the vocabulary in the human compared to the robot condition.

Typically, they manifest in areas such as memory, attention, language, and problem-solving skills. Cognitive impairments can be directly associated with Alzheimer’s disease, as well as stroke, attention deficit, epilepsy, brain trauma, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow direct interaction between the human brain and computers or other external devices. These systems aim to understand users’ intentions and thoughts by detecting, processing, and interpreting brain electrical activity, facilitating communication or environmental control for individuals with impaired mobility, especially advantageous for those with paralysis, spinal cord injuries, or other mobility limitations. BCI systems can utilize different types of brain signals, with noninvasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) measuring brain electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp, while invasive methods involve placing electrodes directly on or inside the brain. The potential applications of BCIs span various fields such as communication, rehabilitation, medical and healthcare services, robotics, neurofeedback training, business and industry, monitoring driver behavior, gaming technologies, and entertainment. When BCI technology is combined with advanced machine learning methods like deep learning, it can work more accurately and effectively. The integration of BCI with deep learning facilitates a more precise analysis of brain signals and a more accurate determination of users’ intentions. This chapter will address the fundamentals and working principles of BCI technology and its potential in combating cognitive impairments. Additionally, it will discuss how deep learning methods can be integrated with BCI and utilized in cognitive impairments.

In this way, it provides an updated overview of the current state of research on the implementation of robotics in students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the methodological domain, 85 scientific documents were collected from the Web of Science database. In these studies, 58,82% adopted a quantitative methodological approach, 22,36% a qualitative one, and 18,82% employed mixed methods. Regarding research design, 18,82% of the studies used a quasi- experimental design, 20% employed a case study design, and 11,86% were pilot studies. A total of 64.7% of the studies were journal articles. The main thematic areas addressed were emotions, attention, engagement, imitation, and human–robot interaction. To select the final sample of documents, the PRISMA methodology was applied. PRISMA is a guideline that enables researchers to clearly and systematically describe the screening and selection process in systematic reviews. Data analysis was performed using SciMAT software, applying network analysis and visualization techniques such as co-word analysis and co-citation analysis. The findings indicated that, throughout the various periods analyzed, the themes of attention and joint attention have been the core topics in the application of robotics to students with autism. In recent years, there has also been a growing focus on the support provided by teachers in the use of robotics for learning. From a practical standpoint, there is a need to provide pedagogical training in robotics for teachers, as well as to design educational activities focused on the development of joint attention and affectivity, which are considered essential elements in promoting autonomy among students with ASD.As future lines of research, it is proposed to include additional bibliometric techniques, such as performance analysis, to obtain time-based information on the most cited articles, the most productive authors, and the journals that accumulate the most relevant publications in the field. All of this knowledge would help to broaden and enrich the insights obtained. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Robotics; SCIMAT; Social interaction; Thematic evolution","","","","Al-Nafjan, Abeer N., Improving Imitation Skills in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Using the NAO Robot and a Human Action Recognition, Diagnostics, 15, 1, (2025); Aria, Massimo, bibliometrix: An R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis, Journal of Informetrics, 11, 4, pp. 959-975, (2017); Aria, Massimo, Mapping the Evolution of Social Research and Data Science on 30 Years of Social Indicators Research, Social Indicators Research, 149, 3, pp. 803-831, (2020); Avello-Martínez, Raidell, Coding and educational robotics and their relationship with computational and creative thinking.

Non-pharmacological therapies, especially digital health interventions (DHIs), show potential in mitigating cognitive impairment related to cancer through tailored and interactive cognitive training. Nonetheless, current research fails to systematically integrate intervention strategies, behavioral change techniques (BCTs), and their effectiveness.ObjectiveThis scoping review sought to delineate existing DHIs for cognitive impairment related to cancer in breast cancer patients, emphasizing intervention attributes, efficacy, and the use of behavior change techniques to guide future research and clinical practice.MethodsFollowing Arksey and O’Malley's framework, nine databases were systematically searched (inception to February 2025). Inclusion criteria were defined using PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study design). Data on intervention characteristics, BCTs, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed via Michie's BCT taxonomy.ResultsNineteen studies were incorporated. DHIs predominantly employed computerized cognitive training (78.94%), virtual reality (VR) (15.78%), and robotics (5.26%). Prominent BCTs encompassed goal setting (100%), feedback/monitoring (89%), and social support (100%). Eighteen investigations indicated substantial cognitive enhancement, six saw better emotional well-being, and two evidenced an elevated quality of life. Gamification and VR therapies resulted in elevated patient adherence and satisfaction.ConclusionDHIs significantly enhance Cognitive Rehabilitation and Cognitive Impairment through cognitive training and multifaceted BCTs. Challenges encompass diverse study designs, insufficient long-term data, and technical obstacles. Future research must include standardized cognitive evaluations, longitudinal investigations, and initiatives to address the digital divide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","behavior change techniques; Breast cancer; cancer-related cognitive impairment; digital health interventions; scoping review","","","","Kuchenbaecker, Karoline B., Risks of breast, ovarian, and contralateral breast cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, JAMA, 317, 23, pp. 2402-2416, (2017); Chin J Bases Clin Gen Surg, (2024); Janelsins, Michelle C., Prevalence, mechanisms, and management of cancer-related cognitive impairment, International Review of Psychiatry, 26, 1, pp. 102-113, (2014); McDonald, Elizabeth S., Clinical diagnosis and management of breast cancer, Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 57, pp. 9-16, (2016); Tao, Xuetong, Incidence, mortality, survival, and disease burden of breast cancer in China compared to other developed countries, Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology, 19, 6, pp. 645-654, (2023); Consequences of Self Objectification Investigating the Impact of Body Image on Female Sexual Functioning Ba, (2015); Sebri, Valeria, How to address the body after breast cancer?

Functional neurological disorder (FND) disrupts this cycle, leading to maladaptive motor responses and a diminished sense of agency. FND includes functional seizures, movement disorders, and cognitive impairments, significantly affecting quality of life. Recent advancements in extended reality (XR) neurotechnologies provide opportunities for novel rehabilitation approaches, leveraging visual and haptic feedback to retrain motor control and restore agency in individuals with functional limb weakness. Objective: This study aimed to co-design and evaluate an XR-based biofeedback platform for upper-limb rehabilitation in FND, incorporating multisensory feedback (visual and haptic) to enhance motor retraining. Methods: A mixed methods design was used. In phase 1, a Delphi survey (N=20, patients with FND) identified key user requirements, emphasizing customizability, real-time feedback, accessibility, and comfort. These insights guided the codevel-opment of an XR biofeedback platform. In phase 2, a co-design workshop with 6 participants (3 FND patient representatives and 3 health care professionals) evaluated the usability of 3 XR training tasks: virtual reality (VR) relaxation task, a guided meditation in a VR calming environment; XR position feedback task (“Hoop Hustle”), a VR-based motion task requiring arm movements to interact with virtual objects, providing real-time positional biofeedback; and XR force feedback task, a haptic robot-assisted exercise using the Human Robotix System (HRX-1) haptic device, applying resistive forces to guide upper limb movements. Participants completed system usability scale (SUS) questionnaires and provided qualitative feedback, which was analyzed using NVivo (QSR International) thematic analysis. Results: The XR position feedback task achieved the highest usability ratings, with 4 out of 6 participants scoring it above 85, indicating “excellent” usability. The VR relaxation task received polarized scores: 2 participants rated it highly (90 and 87.5), while 3 scored it poorly (mid-40s), citing motion discomfort and disengagement. The XR force feedback task had mixed usability outcomes (SUS range: 27.595.0), with 1 participant with functional dystonia struggling significantly (SUS 27.5), while others rated it between 62.5 and 95.0. Qualitative feedback emphasized comfort (lighter headsets and better ergonomic design), immersion and content quality (clearer visuals and reduced distracting audio prompts), personalization (adjustable settings for speed, difficulty, and force resistance), and accessibility (cost concerns and home usability considerations). Overall, participants viewed the XR biofeedback platform as highly promising but in need of fine-tuning. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility and usability of an XR neurotechnology platform for FND rehabilitation, with strong acceptance of XR position feedback, mixed reactions to VR relaxation, and individual-specific usability outcomes for the force feedback task. Findings underscore the need for personalization features and hardware refinement. Future work will focus on enhancing usability, improving accessibility, and evaluating effectiveness in larger clinical trials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","biofeedback; co-design; extended reality; functional neurological disorder; haptics; System Usability Scale; usability","","","","Dutta, Anirban, Bayesian predictive coding hypothesis: Brain as observer's key role in insight, Medical Hypotheses, 195, (2025); O'Mahony, Brian William, Economic Cost of Functional Neurologic Disorders: A Systematic Review, Neurology, 101, 2, pp. E202-E214, (2023); HALLETT, MARK, Functional neurological disorder: new subtypes and shared mechanisms, The Lancet Neurology, 21, 6, pp. 537-550, (2022); Freedom of Information Project Aimed to Explore Issues Reported by Nhs Clinicians and the Fnd Community Regarding Accesses to Treatment for People with Fnd; Taing, Monica, Applying a Stepped-Care Framework for Functional Neurological Disorder Management, Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, 52, 1, pp. 39-41, (2025); Preprints, (2024); Kumar, Deepesh, Virtual reality-based balance training system augmented with operant conditioning paradigm, BioMedical Engineering Online, 18, 1, (2019); Ducroizet, Alexandra, Functional neurological disorder: Clinical manifestations and comorbidities; an online survey, Journal of Clinical Neuroscience, 110, pp. 116-125, (2023); Stone, Jon, Explanation as treatment for functional neurologic disorders, Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 139, pp. 543-553, (2016); Hirjak, Dusan, The sensorimotor domain in the research domain criteria system: progress and perspectives, Der Nervenarzt, 92, 9, pp. 915-924, (2021)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","28183045","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012128408"

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of various digital interventions in improving poststroke cognitive function and provide evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, and CNKI databases from their inception to January 2025, with no restrictions on language or publication year. Randomized controlled trials evaluating digital interventions (eg, virtual reality [VR], computer-assisted cognitive therapy [CACT], and robot-assisted therapy [RAT]) for poststroke cognitive impairment in adults (aged≥18 y) were included. Eligible studies reported outcomes measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), with cognitive improvement quantified through pre- to postintervention scores. Multiple researchers independently extracted data. Network meta-analysis was performed using R software, incorporating consistency or inconsistency models (based on Deviance Information Criterion differences), random-effects models, and I2 statistics to assess heterogeneity. Sources of heterogeneity were analyzed through sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression. Intervention efficacy was ranked using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) values. Robustness and consistency were validated via Egger test, sensitivity analyses, and node-splitting methods. Evidence quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Results: A total of 2128 articles were retrieved, with 27 meeting the inclusion criteria. Compared to conventional rehabilitation or care (C), CACT demonstrated significant superiority in MoCA scores (mean difference [MD]=3.03, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.38; SUCRA=91.53%); while cognitive training (CCT) demonstrated no statistical difference (MD=0.70, 95% CI −0.88 to 2.28). The ordering is CACT>VR>RAT>CCT. For MMSE scores, RAT ranked highest in efficacy (MD=5.99, 95% CI 3.20 to 8.79; SUCRA=99.44%); whereas both VR (MD=1.34, 95% CI −0.94 to 3.62) and CCT (MD=1.12, 95% CI −1.46 to 3.69) showed no significant improvement. The ordering is RAT>CACT>CCT>VR. Conclusions: Digital therapies are effective in improving cognitive functioning in patients post stroke. CACT showed superior efficacy on the MoCA (emphasizing executive functioning), while RAT had the highest efficacy in the MMSE (focusing on basic cognition), suggesting different domain-specific effects. However, caution is warranted due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, risk of bias, and limited sample sizes in some studies. Future research should focus on optimizing intervention protocols, integrating neuromodulation or traditional rehabilitation techniques, and exploring cost-effective clinical implementation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cognitive impairment; cognitive training; computer-assisted therapy; robotics; stroke; virtual reality","adult; age; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; cognition; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; cognitive therapy; computer assisted therapy; controlled study; digital technology; evidence based practice; human; meta analysis; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; neuromodulation; neurorehabilitation; occupational therapy; robot-assisted procedure; robot-assisted therapy; stroke complication; systematic review; virtual reality; cognitive behavioral therapy; complication; etiology; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); stroke rehabilitation; therapy; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Virtual Reality","","","Rost, Natalia Sana, Post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia, Circulation Research, 130, 8, pp. 1252-1271, (2022); Tang, Eugene Yee Hing, Longitudinal effect of stroke on cognition: A systematic review, Journal of the American Heart Association, 7, 2, (2018); Zhou, Liqin, The influence of eight cognitive training regimes upon cognitive screening tool performance in post-stroke survivors: a network meta-analysis, Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, 16, (2024); Pendlebury, Sarah Tamsin, Prevalence, incidence, and factors associated with pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis, The Lancet Neurology, 8, 11, pp. 1006-1018, (2009); Laver, Kate E., Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation., Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 9, (2011); Khan, Ammar Ahmed, Virtual reality in stroke recovery: a meta-review of systematic reviews, Bioelectronic Medicine, 10, 1, (2024); Liu, Mingxiao, Augmented feedback modes during functional grasp training with an intelligent glove and virtual reality for persons with traumatic brain injury, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 10, (2023); Mingming, Ye, Effectiveness of computer-based training on post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 32, 3, pp. 481-497, (2022); Youze, He, Computer aided self-regulation learning and cognitive training improve generalization ability of patients with poststroke cognitive impairment, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Malik, Mishaim, Stroke Lesion Segmentation and Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review, Bioengineering, 11, 1, (2024)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","14388871","","","40705404","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011491987"

Some of these teachers educate individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and promoting their employability requires providing them access to the so-called STEAM disciplines. However, teaching STEAM to students with disabilities is challenging and often hindered by a lack of resources, time, or training in the use of tools and methodologies. The ROBOSTEAMSEN, an Erasmus + European project, addresses this issue by educating teachers in the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to foster STEAM education. A key aspect of this project is the classification of methodological and technological resources that teachers can use. To this end, the project developed a taxonomy that allows the classification of resources to address various challenges associated with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD). The taxonomy includes the characterization of different aspects such as possible disabilities and their levels, the student's profile, their preferences, difficulties, learning objectives, and educational activities. This paper presents this taxonomy, discusses its various elements and demonstrates its implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Learning Methodologies; IDD; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities; Robotics; STEAM","","","","García-Peñalvo, Francisco José, Exploring the computational thinking effects in pre-university education, Computers in Human Behavior, 80, pp. 407-411, (2018); García-Peñalvo, Francisco José, Introducing coding and computational thinking in the schools: The TACCLE 3 – coding project experience, pp. 213-226, (2018); European Higher Education Area in 2018 Bologna Process Implementation Report, (2018); Coding Erasmus Project Website; Robosteam Project Integrating Steam and Computational Thinking Development by Using Robotics and Physical Devices, (2021); J Inf Technol Res 12 Vviii, (2019); García-Holgado, Alicia, A Model for Bridging the Gender Gap in STEM in Higher Education Institutions, Lecture Notes in Educational Technology, pp. 1-19, (2022); Amo-Filva, Daniel, CreaSTEAM.

This study introduces a novel RET focused on imitation training to promote social skills, incorporating gestures from children's songs to enhance engagement. This work presents preliminary findings from eight autistic children who underwent a 12 -week intervention, assessing improvements in adaptive abilities using the Adaptive Behavioral Assessment Scale (ABAS-II) and Primo Vocabolario del Bambino (PVB), with the Social Adaptive Domain (SAD) of ABAS-II as the primary outcome. Treatment adherence is measured as the proportion of correctly imitated gestures, which is also quantified by leveraging a CNN-based gesture recognition algorithm. While results show overall trends of improvement, the primary outcome does not reach statistically significant. However, adherence was significantly higher in subjects with improved social skills, underscoring the importance of active participation The gesture recognition algorithm achieved an F1-score of 0.57. While findings are promising, the comparison with a control group will permit differentiating the outcomes of the therapy protocol and the developmental trajectory. Future efforts should focus on improving the gesture-imitation algorithm and refining adherence assessment tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Robot-Enhanced Therapy; Social skills","Behavioral research; Gesture recognition; Intelligent robots; Personnel training; Adaptive ability; Assessment scale; Autism; Autism intervention; Autistic children; Behavioral assessment; Empirical evaluations; Gesture recognition algorithm; Robot-enhanced therapy; Social skills; Diseases; algorithm; autism; child; female; gesture; human; imitation; male; physiology; preschool child; procedures; rehabilitation; robotics; therapy; treatment outcome; Algorithms; Autistic Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gestures; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Male; Robotics; Treatment Outcome","","","Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); MMWR Surveill Summ, (2023); Sandbank, Micheal P., Project AIM: Autism intervention meta-analysis for studies of young children, Psychological Bulletin, 146, 1, pp. 1-29, (2020); Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, (2023); Rizvi, Naba, Are Robots Ready to Deliver Autism Inclusion?: A Critical Review, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2024); Cao, Hoang Long, Robot-Enhanced Therapy: Development and Validation of Supervised Autonomous Robotic System for Autism Spectrum Disorders Therapy, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 26, 2, pp. 49-58, (2019); DiPietro, Joan, Computer-and robot-assisted therapies to aid social and intellectual functioning of children with autism spectrum disorder, Medicina (Lithuania), 55, 8, (2019); Hodges, Holly, Autism spectrum disorder: Definition, epidemiology, causes, and clinical evaluation, Translational Pediatrics, 9, pp. S55-S65, (2020); Marino, Flavia, Outcomes of a Robot-Assisted Social-Emotional Understanding Intervention for Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 50, 6, pp. 1973-1987, (2020); ACM Transactions on Human Robot Interaction Thri, (2019)","","IEEE Computer Society","","2025 International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, ICORR 2025","","Chicago; IL","210374","19457898; 19457901","9781665488297; 9798350342758; 9781467360241; 9781728127552; 9781538622964; 9781479918072; 9781424498628; 9798350380682","","40644262","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011138477"

When these delays are detected early, movement training can significantly improve patients' quality of life. Instrumented toys have the potential to solve the pressing need for easily accessible, inexpensive diagnostic tools for infant development. While many studies have focused on developing toys for sensor-based assessment, the body of work dedicated to developing quantitative measurements from this data is minimal and has several limitations. Using a consistent and novel video coding methodology, a case study of 18 preterm and full-term infants' videotaped interactions with the Play and Neuro Development Assessment (PANDA) Gym, an affordable, mechatronic, and sensor-based play environment, were analyzed. The coding methodology was able to quantify infant interactions with the PANDA toy and differences between preterm and full-term infants, but future analysis of involuntary interactions and a larger sample size are needed to determine whether results are consistent with expected developmental milestones. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Diagnosis; Image coding; Robotics; Toys; Video recording; Cerebral palsy; Development assessments; Developmental delay; Developmental disability; Diagnostics tools; Full term infants; Pressung; Preterm infants; Quality of life; Robotic toys; Video signal processing; child development; devices; female; human; infant; male; newborn; physiology; prematurity; procedures; recreation; robotics; videorecording; Child Development; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Male; Play and Playthings; Video Recording","","","undefined, (2024); Allievi, Alessandro Gabriele, Technology-aided assessment of sensorimotor function in early infancy, Frontiers in Neurology, 5, OCT, (2014); Allen, Marilee C., Neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants, Current Opinion in Neurology, 21, 2, pp. 123-128, (2008); Platt, Mary Jane, Outcomes in preterm infants, Public Health, 128, 5, pp. 399-403, (2014); What are the Early Signs of Cerebral Palsy Nichd Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Kuo, Hsinhung, Hand Use and Grasp Sensor System in Monitoring Infant Fine Motor Development, Archives of Rehabilitation Research and Clinical Translation, 4, 3, (2022); Campolo, Domenico, Design of a sensorized ball for ecological behavioral analysis of infants, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1529-1534, (2007); IEEE R A Magazine, (2012); Takada, Ryosuke, A technique for touch force sensing using a waterproof device's built-in barometer, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, Part F127655, pp. 2140-2146, (2017); Ramanathan, Vishal, The Design and Development of Instrumented Toys for the Assessment of Infant Cognitive Flexibility, Sensors, 23, 5, (2023)","","IEEE Computer Society","","2025 International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, ICORR 2025","","Chicago; IL","210374","19457898; 19457901","9781665488297; 9798350342758; 9781467360241; 9781728127552; 9781538622964; 9781479918072; 9781424498628; 9798350380682","","40644027","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011136693"

Thanks to the ability to actively assist movement and dynamically adapt the assistance level, actuated devices can support individuals with a wide range of deficits. However, these devices are often complex to use, and their application in a fully unsupervised setting has rarely been explored. Here, we present a pilot study investigating the feasibility of unsupervised therapy with ReHandyBot, an actuated device for upper limb rehabilitation. The increase in therapy dose achieved during unsupervised training, device usability and user experience were evaluated. Stroke inpatients of a rehabilitation clinic learned how to use the device for two weeks with progressively decreasing levels of supervision. After discharge, they could take it home for two weeks of unsupervised therapy. Four of the five recruited participants learned how to use the device without supervision, and three completed the protocol. During the two weeks at home, on average they performed 518.3 minutes of therapy with ReHandyBot. Usability and user experience ratings show that the device was well accepted. These positive results support larger studies investigating unsupervised home therapy with ReHandyBot and suggest that active devices can be used by patients with no to mild cognitive impairments at home without the supervision of external persons. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Intelligent robots; Patient treatment; Unsupervised learning; Feasibility studies; Healthcare systems; Pilot studies; Robot-assisted therapies; Stroke survivors; Training devices; Unsupervised training; Upper limbs; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Users' experiences; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; adult; aged; devices; feasibility study; female; home care; human; male; middle aged; pilot study; procedures; robotics; stroke rehabilitation; upper limb; Adult; Aged; Feasibility Studies; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Robotics; Stroke Rehabilitation; Upper Extremity","","","Lawrence, Enas S., Estimates of the prevalence of acute stroke impairments and disability in a multiethnic population, Stroke, 32, 6, pp. 1279-1284, (2001); Ward, Nick S., Intensive upper limb neurorehabilitation in chronic stroke: Outcomes from the Queen Square programme, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 90, 5, pp. 498-506, (2019); Jesus, Tiago S., Human resources for health (and rehabilitation): Six Rehab-Workforce Challenges for the century, Human Resources for Health, 15, 1, (2017); Broderick, Michelle, Self-Directed Exergaming for Stroke Upper Limb Impairment Increases Exercise Dose Compared to Standard Care, Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair, 35, 11, pp. 974-985, (2021); Wittmann, Frieder, Self-directed arm therapy at home after stroke with a sensor-based virtual reality training system, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, 13, 1, (2016); Bressi, Federica, Upper limb home-based robotic rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients: A pilot study, Frontiers in Neurorobotics, 17, (2023); Ranzani, Raffaele, Towards a Platform for Robot-Assisted Minimally-Supervised Therapy of Hand Function: Design and Pilot Usability Evaluation, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, 9, (2021); Devittori, Giada, Automatic and Personalized Adaptation of Therapy Parameters for Unsupervised Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation: a Pilot Evaluation, IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, 2022-July, (2022); Devittori, Giada, Unsupervised robot-assisted rehabilitation after stroke: feasibility, effect on therapy dose, and user experience, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, 21, 1, (2024); Ranzani, Raffaele, An online method to monitor hand muscle tone during robot-assisted rehabilitation, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 10, (2023)","","IEEE Computer Society","","2025 International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, ICORR 2025","","Chicago; IL","210374","19457898; 19457901","9781665488297; 9798350342758; 9781467360241; 9781728127552; 9781538622964; 9781479918072; 9781424498628; 9798350380682","","40644292","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011135887"

However, a gap remains in designing culturally relevant and developmentally appropriate gestures, particularly in the Sri Lankan context. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition impacting early education, often remains underdiagnosed, exacerbating learning challenges. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing robot-child interactions for ASD screening to minimize such delays. Expressive gestures were developed for the NAO6 humanoid robot to engage Sinhala-speaking children aged 2 to 6 years, including those with ASD, in Sri Lanka. Using the NAOqi Python API and Choregraphe simulator, culturally aligned gestures expressing emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and more were designed and synchronized with voice and LED effects. Pilot studies with typical children demonstrated the significance of linguistic and cultural alignment in enhancing engagement, emotional response, and trust. By addressing cultural nuances and advancing early ASD screening, this framework holds potential for broader applications in education, therapy, and diagnosis, improving human-robot interactions globally. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorder; gesture synthesis; Human-Robot Interaction","Agricultural robots; Anthropomorphic robots; Diagnosis; Diseases; Educational robots; Human computer interaction; Intelligent robots; Linguistics; Man machine systems; Natural language processing systems; Social robots; Sodium compounds; Autism spectrum disorders; Child-robot interactions; Condition; Expressive gestures; Gesture synthesis; Humans-robot interactions; Language processing; Natural languages; Navigation computers; Machine design","","","Craenen, Bart G.W., Shaping Gestures to Shape Personalities: The Relationship between Gesture Parameters, Attributed Personality Traits and Godspeed Scores, pp. 699-704, (2018); Richardson, Kathleen, Robot enhanced therapy for children with autism (DREAM): A social model of autism, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 37, 1, pp. 30-39, (2018); Ricks, Daniel J., Trends and considerations in robot-assisted autism therapy, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 4354-4359, (2010); Jayawardena, Aparna, A Multimodal Interaction System for Speech-Based Autism Intervention in Sinhala-Speaking Sri Lankan Children using the NAO Robot, pp. 205-210, (2024); Erden, Mustafa Suphi, Emotional Postures for the Humanoid-Robot Nao, International Journal of Social Robotics, 5, 4, pp. 441-456, (2013); Salem, Maha, Generation and Evaluation of Communicative Robot Gesture, International Journal of Social Robotics, 4, 2, pp. 201-217, (2012); Brooks, Andrew G., Behavioral overlays for non-verbal communication expression on a humanoid robot, Autonomous Robots, 22, 1, pp. 55-74, (2007); Balmik, Archana, NAO Robot Teleoperation with Human Motion Recognition, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 47, 2, pp. 1137-1146, (2022); Baranwal, Neha, Development of a Framework for Human–Robot interactions with Indian Sign Language Using Possibility Theory, International Journal of Social Robotics, 9, 4, pp. 563-574, (2017); de Beir, Albert, Enhancing Emotional Facial Expressiveness on NAO: A Case Study Using Pluggable Eyebrows, International Journal of Social Robotics, 8, 4, pp. 513-521, (2016)","Mahanama, T.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2025 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering, SCSE 2025","","Colombo","209602","","9798331523268","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009458559"

These difficulties are addressed by special education programs in several ways—for instance, peer-to-peer communication using pictograms or tablet-based games to rehearse social situations and learn about facial expressions. Social robots have shown potential as vehicles for these activities. They can be perceived as “safe” interaction partners, as well as entail a special motivation for children who are fascinated by technology. In this paper, we describe the experience of two pilot studies study using a NAO robot for social communication at a special education school in Norway involving five and fifteen (N<inf>1</inf> = 5, and N<inf>2</inf> = 15) children with autism, respectively. Each child used the robot for 1–2 sessions with the help of their main teacher and an additional teacher operating the robot. The teachers could select from a repertoire of activities that utilized the robot in various ways. The sessions were videotaped and analyzed by a multidisciplinary team composed of pedagogists, teachers, and researchers on ICTs, ethics, health, pedagogy and technology. The videos show that some children initiated and reciprocated communication with the robot in different contexts and with various degrees of support from the teachers. This paper describes design recommendations towards a longer study and pedagogical and ethical reflections on particular experiences observed in the pilot study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Participatory Design; Social Communication; Social Robots","Agricultural robots; Distributed computer systems; Educational robots; Man machine systems; Philosophical aspects; Social robots; Teaching; Autism; Children with autisms; Education programmes; Participatory design; Peer-to-peer communications; Pilot studies; Social communications; Special education; Teachers'; Machine design","","","Sacco, Rosemarie, A systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents in Europe, European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 33, 9, pp. 2877-2894, (2024); undefined; Bougeard, Clémence, Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Co-morbidities in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Literature Review, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 12, (2021); Moon, Sunjae, Mobile device applications and treatment of autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness, Archives of Disease in Childhood, 105, 5, pp. 458-462, (2020); Aspiranti, Kathleen B., iPads/tablets and students with autism: A meta-analysis of academic effects, Assistive Technology, 32, 1, pp. 23-30, (2020); Chen, Weiqin, Multitouch tabletop technology for people with autism spectrum disorder: A review of the literature, Procedia Computer Science, 14, pp. 198-207, (2012); Koumpouros, Y., Wearables and mobile technologies in Autism Spectrum Disorder interventions: A systematic literature review, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 66, (2019); Cano, Sandra Patricia, Affective communication for socially assistive robots (SARs) for children with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review, Sensors, 21, 15, (2021); Naneva, Stanislava, A Systematic Review of Attitudes, Anxiety, Acceptance, and Trust Towards Social Robots, International Journal of Social Robotics, 12, 6, pp. 1179-1201, (2020); ACM Transactions on Human Robot Interaction Thri, (2019)","Antona, M.; Stephanidis, C.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","19th International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction, UAHCI 2025, held as part of the 27th HCI International Conference, HCII 2025","","Gothenburg","333229","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008368379"

Children with ASD often show a limited social intervention approach using traditional therapeutic techniques. More recently, the inclusion of robotics has brought innovation for children with ASDs. In a robotic therapy setting, the safety and repetition of sessions encourage children to express themselves more proficiently through social skills. Additionally, these robotic systems can provide the children with feedback on their social behavior that encourages learning and growth. A large amount of research work in this area presented the proof of concept that robot treatment was effective for ASD children. Research also demonstrates that robotic treatment improves the learning of the prescribed social behavior and interaction skills more than the traditional therapy. Moreover, it is found that children feel more at ease interacting with robots than with people, which boosts their confidence in social situations. The robotic tools can also teach children about things like facial expressions and body language. While this use of robotics is still developing, still the development in this field is promising. Robots could be a great way for children with autism to learn and practice their social skills. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorder (ASD); human-robot interaction; Robotics; social skills development","Consumer behavior; Economic and social effects; Emotional intelligence; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Robotic assembly; Social aspects; Social behavior; Social psychology; Autism spectrum disorder; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Humans-robot interactions; Interaction skills; Skills development; Social behaviour; Social interactions; Social skill development; Social skills; Social robots","","","Sial, Sara Baber, A Preliminary Study on Effectiveness of a Standardized Multi-Robot Therapy for Improvement in Collaborative Multi-Human Interaction of Children with ASD, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 109466-109474, (2020); Amirova, Aida, Effects of Parental Involvement in Robot-Assisted Autism Therapy, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 53, 1, pp. 438-455, (2023); Anzalone, Salvatore Maria, Quantifying patterns of joint attention during human-robot interactions: An application for autism spectrum disorder assessment, Pattern Recognition Letters, 118, pp. 42-50, (2019); Arent, Krzysztof, Social robot in diagnosis of autism among preschool children, pp. 652-656, (2019); Bartl-Pokorny, Katrin D., Robot-Based Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Literature Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 165433-165450, (2021); Current Robotics Reports, (2020); Robaczewski, Adam, Socially Assistive Robots: The Specific Case of the NAO, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 4, pp. 795-831, (2021); Cao, Hoang Long, Robot-Enhanced Therapy: Development and Validation of Supervised Autonomous Robotic System for Autism Spectrum Disorders Therapy, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 26, 2, pp. 49-58, (2019); Cao, Hoang Long, Robot-Assisted Joint Attention: A Comparative Study between Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Typically Developing Children in Interaction with NAO, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 223325-223334, (2020); Chita-Tegmark, Meia, Assistive Robots for the Social Management of Health: A Framework for Robot Design and Human–Robot Interaction Research, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 2, pp. 197-217, (2021)","","Elsevier","","","","","","","9780443264818; 9780443264801","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005898399"

Over the years, some technology-assisted therapies for those children were developed and have proven effective. However, in real-world practices, these therapies have limitations, such as lacking of attractiveness to children. Therefore, we propose HAN, an interactive robot designed to teach social skills to children with HFA based on TIP (Teaching Interaction Procedure) therapy. We aim to design an attractive appearance and a series of attractive interfaces to provide a better therapy experience for children with HFA. We structured social interactions through teaching, interaction, feedback, and generalization; thus, HAN systematically taught a wide range of social skills through a comprehensive curriculum.

This study explores the impacts of a month-long, in-home intervention designed to promote triadic interactions between a social robot, a child with ASD, and their caregiver. Our results indicate that the intervention successfully promoted appropriate gaze behavior, encouraging children with ASD to follow the robot's gaze, resulting in more frequent and prolonged instances of spontaneous eye contact and joint attention with their caregivers. Additionally, we observed specific timelines for behavioral variability and novelty effects among users. Furthermore, diagnostic measures for ASD emerged as strong predictors of gaze patterns for both caregivers and children.

Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) utilizes robotic assistance to facilitate neuroplastic changes through repetitive training and feedback. We aimed to map the evidence of RAGT in non-ambulatory individuals with impaired consciousness or cognitive functioning, focusing on the rationales underpinning its use and the assessment methods employed. Method: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA scoping review guidelines, we systematically searched for studies involving adults with severe acquired brain injury. Source selection, data extraction, and charting were performed in duplicate. Results: Out of 10 444 records screened, seven were included, involving 162 participants. The studies included one randomized and two non-randomized clinical trials, two retrospective studies, and two case reports. RAGT aimed to improve physical recovery (n = 6), arousal stimulation (n = 4), and safety (n = 4). Twenty-six outcome measures were reported. Conclusion: Our review highlights a research gap in RAGT for individuals with severe brain injury and cognitive impairments. Specifically, the underlying rationales need investigation, and standardized outcome measures must be established. RAGT shows potential in improving functional recovery and consciousness, but future studies must address safety, and feasibility while navigating ethical challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain injury; disorders of consciousness; rehabilitation technologies; robot-assisted gait training; stroke","acquired brain injury; arousal; clinical outcome; clinical practice guideline; cognitive defect; consciousness disorder; data extraction; human; injury severity; Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist; population research; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; robot-assisted gait training; safety; time to treatment; brain injury; complication; convalescence; gait; kinesiotherapy; physiology; procedures; rehabilitation; robotics; Brain Injuries; Exercise Therapy; Gait; Humans; Recovery of Function; Robotics","","","Ng, Harriet, A systematic review of head-up tilt to improve consciousness in people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness, Clinical Rehabilitation, 35, 1, pp. 13-25, (2021); Spiess, Martina Rebekka, Getting the Best Out of Advanced Rehabilitation Technology for the Lower Limbs: Minding Motor Learning Principles, PM and R, 10, 9, pp. S165-S173, (2018); Mehrholz, Jan, Electromechanical-assisted training for walking after stroke, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2020, 10, (2020); Bagnato, Sergio, The role of plasticity in the recovery of consciousness, Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 184, pp. 375-395, (2022); Gillespie, Jaime, Utilization of overground exoskeleton gait training during inpatient rehabilitation: a descriptive analysis, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, 20, 1, (2023); Esquenazi, Alberto, Clinical application of robotics and technology in the restoration of walking, pp. 223-248, (2016); Elliott, Louise, Effect of posture on levels of arousal and awareness in vegetative and minimally conscious state patients: A preliminary investigation [10], Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 76, 2, pp. 298-299, (2005); Wilson, Barbara Ann, The effect of positioning on the level of arousal and awareness in patients in the vegetative state or the minimally conscious state: A replication and extension of a previous finding, Brain Impairment, 14, 3, pp. 475-479, (2013); Riberholt, Christian Gunge, Patients with severe acquired brain injury show increased arousal in tilt-table training, Danish Medical Journal, 60, 12, (2013); Rosenfelder, Martin Justinus, Effect of robotic tilt table verticalization on recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness: a randomized controlled trial, Journal of Neurology, 270, 3, pp. 1721-1734, (2023)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","1362301X; 02699052","","BRAIE","40323792","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004352502"

This article examines how robotics addresses the unique challenges faced by children with ASD, emphasizing socially assistive robotics (SARs) as tools to improve social interactions and reduce the difficulties these children face in traditional educational settings. While skepticism exists regarding the replacement of human educators with robots, studies show that robots can complement teaching by providing consistent, non-judgmental, and engaging environments for skill development. Research highlights the potential of SARs to model social behaviors, promote interactive learning, and assist in therapy sessions. Child-friendly designs, such as humanoid or animal-like robots, have proven effective in engaging children with ASD. However, limitations persist, including small sample sizes and a lack of robust clinical trials. Most research in this field focuses on technological advancements rather than evaluating the efficacy of robots in real-world educational contexts. Despite these challenges, robotics offers significant potential for creating inclusive learning environments and enhancing the quality of education for children with unique learning needs. The article calls for further research to optimize the integration of robotics into educational and therapeutic frameworks, ensuring equal opportunities and societal inclusion for individuals with ASD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ASD; education; robotics; special","","","","Tahan, Mohammad, Artificial intelligence applications and psychology: An overview, Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica, 21, 3, pp. 119-126, (2019); Tahan, Mohammad, Robot-based psychological intervention program for the prevention of child sexual abuse: An overview, Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica, 25, 1, pp. 18-25, (2023); Starks, Allison C., “What about special ed?“: Barriers and enablers for teaching with technology in special education, Computers and Education, 193, (2023); Kasari, Connie L., Assessing the minimally verbal school-aged child with autism spectrum disorder, Autism Research, 6, 6, pp. 479-493, (2013); Severe Special Need Student Inclusion in the Classroom Masters Theses Capstone Projects Northwestern College Orange, (2023); Tahan, Mohammad, Designing, assessing, and effectiveness a psychological interventions program with a robot for children sexual care, Middle East Current Psychiatry, 30, 1, (2023); Tahan, Mohammad, Application of artificial intelligence for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in psychology: a review, Neuropsychiatria i Neuropsychologia, 18, 1-2, pp. 36-45, (2023); Lodge, Jason M., Understanding Difficulties and Resulting Confusion in Learning: An Integrative Review, Frontiers in Education, 3, (2018); Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans, (2018); Kumazaki, Hirokazu, Brief Report: A Novel System to Evaluate Autism Spectrum Disorders Using Two Humanoid Robots, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 49, 4, pp. 1709-1716, (2019)","","Professionalnye Izdaniya","","","","","","24142212; 22201122","","","","Russian","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003949009"

Early screening, diagnosis, and intervention can effectively reduce the level of deficits in individuals with autism. However, traditional methods of screening, diagnosis, and intervention rely on the professionalism of psychiatrists and require a great deal of time and effort, resulting in a large proportion of individuals with autism being diagnosed after the age of 6. Artificial intelligence (AI) combined with machine learning is being used to improve the efficiency of early screening, diagnosis, and intervention of autism in young children. This review aims to summarize AI-assisted methods for early screening, diagnosis, and intervention of autism in young children (infants, toddlers, and preschoolers). To achieve early screening and diagnosis of autism in young children, AI methods have built predictive models to improve the automation of early behavioral diagnosis, analyzed brain imaging and genetic data to break the age barrier for diagnosis, and established intelligent screening systems for early mass screening. For early intervention of autism in young children, AI methods built intelligent education systems to optimize the teaching and learning environment and provide individualized interventions, constructed intelligent monitoring systems for dynamic tracking, and created intelligent support systems to provide continuous support and meet the diverse needs of young children with autism. As AI continues to develop, further research is needed to build a large and shared database on autism, to generalize and migrate the effects of AI interventions, and to improve the appearance and performance of AI-powered robots, to reduce failure rates and costs of AI technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; autism; early diagnosis; early intervention; early screening; machine learning; young children","artificial intelligence; autism; child; diagnosis; early diagnosis; early intervention; human; infant; learning environment; machine learning; mass screening; mental health; neuroimaging; predictive model; preschool child; professionalism; psychiatrist; review; screening; toddler","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Thabtah, F.

One of the areas where it is having a greater expansion is education. Technology, therefore, enables the adaptation to the diverse learning needs of students by facilitating the creation of personalized learning plans. In recent years, students with autistic disorder are increasingly present in the classroom. Consequently, various emerging technologies such as virtual reality, robotics, augmented reality, mixed reality, and artificial intelligence has been developed to cater to the visual learning and systematic tasks required by these students by creating personalized learning systems. Thus, the objective is to perform a bibliometric analysis of trends in the use of emerging technologies during the period 1996–2023 for students with autism spectrum disorder. For the development of the research, the Web of Science database was chosen, where a series of search criteria were applied, and the documents were filtered using the PRISMA methodology. A sample of 888 documents was obtained. The results showed that during the period 2015–2023 it was the most productive period with the highest number of appointments.

This experimental study carried out a social robot-based intervention in a preschool setting to investigate the potential of robotic technology to transform inclusive pedagogical approaches with young children with ASD. The study examined the relationships between children and educational figures and between children and the Nao robot during motor activities in two comparative preschool settings. 20 children aged between 24 and 36 months were involved, divided into two groups of ten subjects. Each group included a child with autism. The research aims to provide evidence for the creation of specific robotic educational mediation devices, to promote communicative-relational skills of educators in the preschool context, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the NAO robot during motor activity sessions for children with autism, examining its impact on children’s involvement, attention, and on motor skills and coordination. The research tools and phases, carried out within the micro-pedagogical and phenomenological theoretical-methodological approach, are described. The interactions and meanings are pedagogically analyzed in the framework of the didactics of the implicit. The results show that children were engaged with the robot and children with ASD had an interest in the robot sessions. In one case, this involvement was prompted by the child’s spontaneous curiosity, while in the other case, it was facilitated by the educator’s support in fostering the child’s relation with the robot alongside his peers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child–robot interaction; Early childhood education; Inclusive education; Social robotics for autism; Social robots in education","","","","Belpaeme, Tony, Social robots for education: A review, Science Robotics, 3, 21, (2018); Bennett, Matthew, A Meta-analysis of DSM-5 Autism Diagnoses in Relation to DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR, Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 3, 2, pp. 119-124, (2016); Cummins, Ariane, Motor coordination, empathy, and social behaviour in school-aged children, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 47, 7, pp. 437-442, (2005); Díaz-Boladeras, Marta, Robots for inclusive classrooms: a scoping review, Universal Access in the Information Society, 24, 1, pp. 127-151, (2025); Dubois-Sage, Marion, People with Autism Spectrum Disorder Could Interact More Easily with a Robot than with a Human: Reasons and Limits, Behavioral Sciences, 14, 2, (2024); Fang, Ning, Role of Socially Assistive Robots in Reducing Anxiety and Preserving Autonomy in Children, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, 2022-March, pp. 754-759, (2022); No More Failures Ten Steps to Equity in Education, (2007); Gargot, Thomas, Automatic Assessment of Motor Impairments in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review, Cognitive Computation, 14, 2, pp. 624-659, (2022); Gómez-Espinosa, Ana, Assisted Robots in Therapies for Children with Autism in Early Childhood, Sensors, 24, 5, (2024); Grossard, Charline, ICT and autism care: State of the art, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, 31, 6, pp. 474-483, (2018)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","1860949X; 18609503","9783031963100; 9783642034510; 9783540768029; 9783642364051; 9783031852510; 9783540959717; 9783031534447; 9783642054402; 9783642327254; 9783030949099","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002448356"

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders are said to perform less well on this test than typically developing children or children with intellectual disabilities. This might suggest a deficit in theory of mind in autism, but this idea is currently being challenged. Other skills seems to be involved in the false-belief task, such as language pragmatics, the ability to interpret language in context. Indeed, the test question is ambiguous: it can lead to different interpretations. Failure could therefore be due to a difference in interpretation between the child and the experimenter. For people with limited pragmatic language skills (such as people with autism or typically developing children under 4), the pragmatic ambiguity of the test question could be an obstacle to success, even if they are otherwise able to attribute a false belief to others. Nevertheless, changing the context could improve performance: the test question, usually asked by an adult experimenter, could become less ambiguous when asked by a NAO robot presented as an ignorant student (mentor-child paradigm). 26 children with autism (and 24 children with intellectual disabilities) passed the false-belief task with a human or with a robot, in order to assess whether they perform better in this new context. The results show no improvement in performance with this paradigm, but children with ASD may have been distracted by the robot during the test, which would have diminished their success. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism Spectrum Disorders; False belief task; Pragmatics; Robot; Theory of mind","Adversarial machine learning; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; False belief task; False beliefs; Improve performance; In contexts; Intellectual disability; Pragmatic; Pragmatic languages; Theory of minds; Microrobots","","","Altschuler, Melody R., Measuring Individual Differences in Cognitive, Affective, and Spontaneous Theory of Mind Among School-Aged Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 48, 11, pp. 3945-3957, (2018); Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); Angeleri, Romina, Pragmatic abilities in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: A study with the ABaCo battery, Minerva Psichiatrica, 57, 3, pp. 93-103, (2016); Baillargeon, Renée E., Psychological reasoning in infancy, Annual Review of Psychology, 67, pp. 159-186, (2016); Baillargeon, Renée E., False-belief understanding in infants, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 14, 3, pp. 110-118, (2010); Baixauli-Fortea, Inmaculada, Pragmatic competence of children with autism spectrum disorder.

It presents the recurrent behavioral patterns and its early diagnosis predicts the development of early language skills, social functioning, academic success, and favorable mental health outcomes in late childhood and adulthood. Scientists are continually working to find the specific causative factors of autism. The wide range of phenotypic presentation makes its diagnosis difficult, thus Artificial Intelligence was introduced which improved accuracy and effectiveness of the detection of autism and machine learning which helped identify the varying phenotypes by analyzing large datasets with ease. The various diagnostic tools include Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Researcher Tools, Machine learning to name a few. The introduction of Social and Educational robots, and Virtual Reality received a more positive feedback due to its simplicity, repeatability and more predictability. Integration of robots into the learning process has dealt effectively with their cognitive and sensory deficiencies and has significantly increased their metacognitive abilities. Virtual reality provides a controlled environment which helps in practicing stress-reduction strategies at various intensities and the leads to the development of confidence in the child and faces the world with a more organized and cognitively tangible approach.

Learning difficulties can show as a variety of deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial organization, motor function, and attention and impulse control. Each child has a unique set of system problems/impairments, functional deficits, barriers to participation in activities, and societal limits. Academic achievement relates to the most generally recognized learning performance issues. Children diagnosed with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) face significant challenges in acquiring and performing basic motor tasks both at home and school, during leisure activities, and within work settings. Notably, mastering handwriting poses a particularly formidable challenge for these children. Handwriting, beyond being a motor skill, holds a pivotal role in the writing process. While conventional therapeutic approaches have been employed to foster handwriting skills in these children, contemporary trends incorporate assistive technologies to facilitate handwriting development. This review aims to categorize diverse forms of assistive technology that contribute to enhancing handwriting proficiency among children with DCD. Through an extensive search across five databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) spanning the years 2012 to 2022, the focus was on interventional studies centered around assistive technologies capable of ameliorating handwriting deficits in children with DCD and learning disabilities. Among the vast pool of 30 articles, merely three met the inclusion criteria. These findings underscore the prevailing scarcity of research in this domain. The consensus drawn from the limited body of literature emphasizes the urgency of addressing fine motor challenges pervasive in children with DCD and learning disabilities. Addressing these challenges is imperative for advancing the speed and legibility of handwriting. Promising interventions include perceptual-motor training programs, robotically assisted three-dimensional repetitive movements, and haptic-visual assistance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assistive technology; DCD; fine motor skills; Handwriting; learning disabilities","","","","Grajo, Lenin C., Interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve Children's academic participation: A systematic review, American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 74, 2, (2020); Fancher, Lee Ann, Handwriting Acquisition and Intervention: A Systematic Review, Journal of Occupational Therapy, Schools, and Early Intervention, 11, 4, pp. 454-473, (2018); Santangelo, Tanya E., A Comprehensive Meta-analysis of Handwriting Instruction, Educational Psychology Review, 28, 2, pp. 225-265, (2016); Overvelde, Anneloes, Handwriting development in grade 2 and grade 3 primary school children with normal, at risk, or dysgraphic characteristics, Research in Developmental Disabilities, 32, 2, pp. 540-548, (2011); Karlsdóttir, Ragnheidur, Problems in developing functional handwriting, Perceptual and Motor Skills, 94, 2, pp. 623-662, (2002); Puranik, Cynthia S., Examining the contribution of handwriting and spelling to written expression in kindergarten children, Reading and Writing, 25, 7, pp. 1523-1546, (2012); Connelly, Vincent J., Predicting the Quality of Composition and Written Language Bursts From Oral Language, Spelling, and Handwriting Skills in Children With and Without Specific Language Impairment, Written Communication, 29, 3, pp. 278-302, (2012); Graham 2011 Chemical Thermodynamics and Information Theory Wit Pdf, (2023); Dinehart, Laura H.Bolzani, Associations Between Low-Income Children's Fine Motor Skills in Preschool and Academic Performance in Second Grade, Early Education and Development, 24, 2, pp. 138-161, (2013); Optometry and Visual Performance, (2016)","Adhau, S.P.; Gawande, S.P.; Rajguru, V.S.","American Institute of Physics","","International Conference on Intelligent Technologies for Sustainable Energy Management and Control 2023, ITSEMC 2023","","Nagpur","204950","0094243X; 15517616","9780735446496; 9780735451889; 9780735441088; 9780735403598; 9780735444577; 9780735443594; 9780735448001; 9780735416437; 9780735402744; 9780735408869","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213566509"

Not only is it a compelling approach to attracting students who would otherwise be uninterested or unable to access CS instruction, but all disciplines have challenges that could use computational tools and methods; thus, an integrated computing approach develops computational literacy in all students [1]. This integrated approach is being increasingly used in elementary settings; however, students with disabilities continue to be left out of these initiatives [2]. This experience report describes how our team used recommendations from the literature to develop an integrated computing curriculum for elementary students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) that combines coding with social skills instruction using DASH robots. Social skills are pivotal for all students, particularly those with ASD, as they learn to problem solve and use critical thinking skills in group settings. We discuss how we used data collection measures to iteratively revise the curriculum and instructional experience. We conclude by previewing our project's next steps and discussing lessons learned from the development process, such as the need for ready-to-use materials with built-in opportunities for differentiation and the need for professional learning communities to support teachers implementing the curriculum. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorder; integrated computing; k-12; robotics; social skills; students with disabilities","Curricula; Robot programming; Social robots; Teaching; Autism spectrum disorders; Computational tools; Elementary students; Integrated approach; Integrated computing; K-12; Science instructions; Social skills; Student with disability; Tools and methods; Students","","","Cs X Approaches Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Interdisciplinary Computing Curricula, (2023); de Araujo, Elaine Cristina Juvino, A Systematic Literature Review on Teaching Programming to People with Cognitive Disabilities, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, 2021-October, (2021); Israel, Maya, Supporting all learners in school-wide computational thinking: A cross-case qualitative analysis, Computers and Education, 82, pp. 263-279, (2015); Novak, Elena, A Research-Practice Partnership Approach for Co-Designing a Culturally Responsive Computer Science Curriculum for Upper Elementary Students, TechTrends, 66, 3, pp. 527-538, (2022); Margulieux, Lauren Elizabeth, Intent and Extent: Computer Science Concepts and Practices in Integrated Computing, ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 24, 3, (2024); Gribble, Jim, Cracking the code: The impact of computer coding on the interactions of a child with autism, pp. 445-450, (2017); Wei, Xin, High School Math and Science Preparation and Postsecondary STEM Participation for Students with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 32, 2, pp. 83-92, (2017); K 12 Computer Science Framework, (2016); Integratingcomputer Science Across the Core Strategies for K 12 Districts, (2020); Strickland, Carla, Action Fractions: The Design and Pilot of an Integrated Math+CS Elementary Curriculum Based on Learning Trajectories, pp. 1149-1155, (2021)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Special Interest Group Computer Science Education (ACM SIGCSE)","1st ACM Virtual Global Computing Education Conference V. 1, SIGCSE Virtual 2024","","Virtual, Online","205372","","9798400705984","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215503012"

Social robots can be effective and helpful technological tools. Social robots are effective in supporting children's learning in some domains, supporting better learning outcomes than with virtual agents and comparable to human tutors when tasks are simple and social. They also support the unique and individual needs of children with a range of special needs (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment) and promote children's mental well-being and physical health. Yet social robots pose conceptual and ethical challenges in that they often present as if they have psychological and social characteristics. Consequently, children often understand social robots as mental, social, and moral entities, albeit to varying degrees depending upon children's ages and robots' features. Moreover, children treat robots in prosocial ways (e.g., helping, sharing) and believe robots deserve moral treatment. Yet, at the same time, some children deliberately abuse robots. Future research is needed to address critical questions and guide recommendations for the promise and limitations of social robots in children's lives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child-robot interaction; Cognition; Education; Human-machine interaction; Morality; Therapy","","","","Peter, Jochen, Asking Today the Crucial Questions of Tomorrow: Social Robots and the Internet of Toys, Studies in Childhood and Youth, pp. 25-46, (2019); Social Robots Market Global Industry Trends Share Size Growth Opportunity and Forecast 2023 2028, (2022); Kahn, Peter H.H., Robovie, you'll have to go into the closet now"": Children's social and moral relationships with a humanoid robot, Developmental Psychology, 48, 2, pp. 303-314, (2012); Severson, Rachel L., Behaving as or behaving as if?

Robots may extend services and provide them in personalised, repeated, and playful ways. However, it is still largely unknown to what extent professionals intend to use robots and what determines their intentions. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework, we aimed to better understand the determinants behind professionals' intentions to use robots with their clients with autism. We conducted an online survey, to which 447 professionals (e.g., psychologists) working with people with autism answered. Our results indicate moderate and well-predicted intentions for the enquired professionals to use a robot with their clients with autism. We found that attitude and perceived social norms are the main predictors of their intentions. Our results also point to the significant and positive influence of moral norms on the attitudes of professionals. Additionally, our preliminary analysis of underlying beliefs to the assessed predictors of intention enables a better understanding on how professionals perceive the place of robots in their work. These results can inspire roboticists who want to build assistive robots for the real world and guide stakeholders when implementing such robots in the health and education sectors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Health and education; Intention to use; Professionals; Robots","Educational robots; Assistive robots; Autism; Health and education; Intention to use; Online surveys; Preliminary analysis; Professional; Real-world; Social norm; Theory of Planned Behavior; Diseases","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Elsabbagh, M., Global Prevalence of Autism and Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Autism Research, 5, 3, pp. 160-179, (2012); Simonoff, Emily A., Psychiatric disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders: Prevalence, comorbidity, and associated factors in a population-derived sample, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 47, 8, pp. 921-929, (2008); Gustavsson, Anders, Cost of disorders of the brain in Europe 2010, European Neuropsychopharmacology, 21, 10, pp. 718-779, (2011); Costa, Andreia Pinto, More Attention and Less Repetitive and Stereotyped Behaviors using a Robot with Children with Autism, pp. 534-539, (2018); Ricks, Daniel J., Trends and considerations in robot-assisted autism therapy, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 4354-4359, (2010); Bird, Geoffrey, Intact automatic imitation of human and robot actions in autism spectrum disorders, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 274, 1628, pp. 3027-3031, (2007); Wainer, Joshua, The effectiveness of using a robotics class to foster collaboration among groups of children with autism in an exploratory study, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 14, 5, pp. 445-455, (2010); Robins, Ben, Robot-mediated joint attention in children with autism: A case study in robot-human interaction, Interaction Studies, 5, 2, pp. 161-198, (2004); Taheri, Alireza R., Social robots as assistants for autism therapy in Iran: Research in progress, pp. 760-766, (2014)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","25739522","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216657249"

The use of cobots, which allow direct human-robot collaboration, enables people with paralyzed upper limbs to actively participate in social activities. This research presents a novel approach through the development of a voice-controlled board game specifically tailored to the inclusion needs of people with severe disabilities. The human voice commands recorded via USB microphones are digitally filtered. Speech recognition of the control commands is performed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG- 16 architecture. The robots activity is controlled utilizing the ROS 2 robot operating system. A portable table-based complete system with a 3D-printed Tic-Tac-Toe playing field and robot assistant for severely disabled paralyzed people has been developed. The robot control system employs a pick-And-place mechanism, seamlessly integrating with speech recognition to enhance gameplay interaction. The CNN model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97%, ensuring reliable speech recognition performance throughout gameplay.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-assistive technologies has enormous potential to offer efficient, cost-effective, and personalized solutions to address these challenges, particularly in everday environments. This systematic review examines the existing evidence for using AI-assistive technologies to support adaptive functioning in people with NDCs in everyday settings. Searches across six databases yielded 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria, focusing on robotics, phones/computers and virtual reality. Studies most frequently recruited children diagnosed with autism and targeted social skills (47%), daily living skills (26%), and communication (16%). Despite promising results, studies addressing broader transdiagnostic needs across different NDC populations are needed. There is also an urgent need to improve the quality of evidence-based research practices. This review concludes that AI holds enormous potential to support adaptive functioning for people with NDCs and for personalized health support.

The two-year multinational randomized controlled LETHE trial evaluates the feasibility of a digitally supported, adapted FINGER intervention among at-risk older adults. Technology is used to complement in-person activities, streamline the intervention delivery, personalize recommendations, and collect digital biomarkers. Methods: Trial includes older adults (60–77 years) with digital readiness/experience with smart devices and increased dementia risk but without substantial cognitive impairment. Participants are enrolled at four sites (Austria, Finland, Italy, Sweden). At baseline, participants were randomized 1:1 ratio to 1) intervention i.e., structured multimodal lifestyle program (including diet, exercise, cognitive training, vascular/metabolic risk management, social stimulation, sleep/stress management) where in-person activities led by professionals are supported with an Android mobile phone application developed by the consortium (the LETHE App); or 2) control i.e., self-guided program (regular health advice; simplified App with no personalized/interactive content). All participants wear smartwatches to gather passive data (e.g., physical activity, sleep). Primary outcomes are retention, adherence, and change in validated dementia risk scores. Secondary outcomes include changes in lifestyle, cognition, stress, sleep, health-related quality of life, and health literacy. Additional outcomes (exploratory) include e.g. participant experiences and dementia-related biomarkers (Alzheimer’s disease blood markers, neuroimaging). A sub-study explores the feasibility of novel interactive technology (audio glasses, social robot). Results: Recruitment began in September 2022, and the last participant was randomized in June 2023. In total, 156 individuals were randomized (mean age 69 years, 65% women; balanced recruitment across the four sites). Vascular and lifestyle risk factors were common (e.g., 65% with hypertension, 69% with hypercholesterolemia, 39% physically inactive), indicating successful recruitment of a population with risk reduction potential. Trial will be completed by summer 2025. Retention until the first post-baseline visit at 6 months is high (n = 2 discontinued, retention 98.7%). Conclusion: LETHE provides crucial information about the feasibility of technology and a digitally supported FINGER lifestyle program to promote brain health. Digital tools specifically designed for older adults could offer potential for large-scale, cost-effective prevention programs.

As robot-enhanced therapy gains more and more attention and proved to be effective in autism, such observations might influence the future development and use of such technologies. The paper is based on an observational study of child-robot interaction, during which multiple modalities were captured and then analyzed to retrieve information on a child’s emotional state. Over 30 children on the autism spectrum from Macedonia, Turkey, Poland, and the United Kingdom took part in our study and interacted with the social robot Kaspar. We captured facial expressions/body posture, voice/vocalizations, physiological signals, and eyegaze-related data. The main contribution of the paper is reporting challenges and lessons learned with regard to interaction, its environment, and observation channels typically used for emotion estimation. The main challenge is the limited availability of channels, especially eyegaze-related (29%) and voice-related (6%) data are not available throughout the entire session. The challenges are of a diverse nature—we distinguished task-based, child-based, and environment-based ones. Choosing the tasks (scenario) and adapting environment, such as room, equipment, accompanying person, is crucial but even with those works done, the child-related challenge is the most important one. Therapists have pointed out to a good potential of those technologies, however, the main challenge to keep a child engaged and focused, remains. The technology must follow a child’s interest, movement, and mood. The main observations are the necessity to train personalized models of emotions as children with autism differ in level of skills and expressions, and emotion recognition technology adaptation in real time (e. g., switching modalities) to capture variability in emotional outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Automatic emotion recognition; Robot-enhanced therapy; Social robots","Adversarial machine learning; Emotion Recognition; Microrobots; Physiological models; Robot applications; Social robots; Autism; Automatic emotion recognition; Child-robot interactions; Children with autisms; Eye-gaze; Multi-modal data; Multiple modalities; Observational study; Robot-enhanced therapy; Diseases","","","Saleem Abdullah, Sharmeen M., Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning, Journal of Applied Science and Technology Trends, 2, 1, pp. 73-79, (2021); Aktas, Sevgi Nur Bilgin, Stress Detection of Children With ASD Using Physiological Signals, (2022); Al-Nafjan, Abeer N., Measuring Engagement in Robot-Assisted Therapy for Autistic Children, Behavioral Sciences, 13, 8, (2023); Alghifari, Muhammad Fahreza, On the use of voice activity detection in speech emotion recognition, Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, 8, 4, pp. 1324-1332, (2019); Alnajjar, Fady Shibata K., Personalized Robot Interventions for Autistic Children: An Automated Methodology for Attention Assessment, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 1, pp. 67-82, (2021); Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Adv Sci Lett, (2018); Banire, Bilikis, One size does not fit all: detecting attention in children with autism using machine learning, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 34, 2, pp. 259-291, (2024); Bartl-Pokorny, Katrin D., Robot-Based Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Literature Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 165433-165450, (2021); Berkoff, David J., Heart rate variability in elite american track-and-field athletes, Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 21, 1, pp. 227-231, (2007)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18754791; 18754805","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208810632"

These features include expressionless facial appearance, tight facial skin, blepharophimosis, sparse eyebrows, and a flat nose. Genetic studies have identified a deletion of 8q22.1 as the cause of the syndrome, however while 26 patients have been reported with the deletion, only 13 displayed the characteristic facial features. Here we report on a 35-year-old male with 8q21.3–q22.1 deletion identified by whole exome sequencing and Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) that presents with typical and atypical features, including neurodevelopmental disorder, mild facial features, and myopathy, which has not been described in a patient with NMLFS to date. Further research will be required to understand the underlying pathogenetic mechanism of this rare genetic disorder. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH); deletion 8q21.3q22.1; Nablus mask-like facial syndrome (NMLFS); whole exome sequencing (WES)","methylphenidate; adult; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; bioinformatics; birth weight; blepharophimosis; case report; child; chromosome analysis; clinical article; comparative genomic hybridization; computer assisted tomography; craniofacial synostosis; cryptorchism; developmental delay; DNA extraction; echocardiography; electromyography; eyebrow; face disorder; facies; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene mutation; genetic disorder; head circumference; heterozygosity; high throughput sequencing; human; human tissue; laryngomalacia; learning disorder; male; mental deficiency; mental disease; microarray analysis; muscle biopsy; muscle hypotonia; myopathy; myopia; nablus mask like facial syndrome; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; preschool child; pyrosequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole exome sequencing; chromosome 8; chromosome deletion; craniofacial malformation; diagnosis; genetics; multiple malformation syndrome; pathology; Abnormalities, Multiple; Adult; Blepharophimosis; Child, Preschool; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Exome Sequencing; Facies; Humans; Male; Nablus mask-like facial syndrome; Phenotype","","methylphenidate, 113-45-1, 298-59-9","Allanson, Judith E., Nablus syndrome: Easy to diagnose yet difficult to solve, American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics, 178, 4, pp. 447-457, (2018); Allanson, Judith E., Nablus mask-like facial syndrome: Deletion of chromosome 8q22.1 is necessary but not sufficient to cause the phenotype, American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part A, 158 A, 9, pp. 2091-2099, (2012); Allanson, Judith E., A second family with blepharo-naso-facial syndrome, Clinical Dysmorphology, 11, 3, pp. 191-194, (2002); Debost-Legrand, Anne, A new case of 8q22.1 microdeletion restricts the critical region for Nablus mask-like facial syndrome, American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part A, 161, 1, pp. 162-165, (2013); Jain, Shailly, A case of 8q22.1 microdeletion without the Nablus mask-like facial syndrome phenotype, European Journal of Medical Genetics, 53, 2, pp. 108-110, (2010); Jamuar, Saumya Shekhar, Deletion of chromosome 8q22.1, a critical region for Nablus mask-like facial syndrome: Four additional cases support a role of genetic modifiers in the manifestation of the phenotype, American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part A, 167, 6, pp. 1400-1405, (2015); Mitrakos, Anastasios K., Coffin-Siris Syndrome 4-Related Spectrum in a Young Woman Caused by a Heterozygous SMARCA4 Deletion Detected by High-Resolution aCGH, Molecular Syndromology, 11, 3, pp. 141-145, (2020); Overhoff, Justin, Refinement of the 8q22.1 microdeletion critical region associated with Nablus mask-like facial syndrome, American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part A, 164, 1, pp. 259-263, (2014); Plagnol, Vincent, A robust model for read count data in exome sequencing experiments and implications for copy number variant calling, Bioinformatics, 28, 21, pp. 2747-2754, (2012); Raas-Rothschild, Annick, The 8q22.1 microdeletion syndrome or Nablus mask-like facial syndrome: Report on two patients and review of the literature, European Journal of Medical Genetics, 52, 2-3, pp. 140-144, (2009)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","15524833; 15524825","","AJMGD","39037278","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199022968"

ASD is characterized by heightened neuroinflammation and irregular neuronal connections. ASD is more frequent in male than female with male–female ratio of around 4:1. ASD affects 2.8% or 1 in 36 8-year-olds, based on the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Various factors like Environmental, Genetic, Epigenetic and Developmental factors are linked with genesis of ASD. Repetitive behaviors, Impaired communication skills, difficulty with social interaction are some of the clinical features of ASD. Current Pharmacotherapy of ASD limits to management of symptoms only, not cure. The stem cell therapy has a promising potential to be a breakthrough in treating ASD. Various types of stem cells have been successfully tested in children with ASD. AI has a potential to emerge as a tool for early detection of ASD. Robotics can assist the children with ASD to overcome the challenges associated with ASD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; ASD; Dopamine; GABA; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Stem cell","4 aminobutyric acid; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; adenylate cyclase; agmatine; canagliflozin; Clitoria ternatea extract; cyclic AMP; docosahexaenoic acid; dopamine; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 3 receptor; fen 164; fenofibrate; fingolimod; G protein coupled receptor; glutamate acetyltransferase; gwp 42003 p; histone deacetylase; homotaurine; li 79; lycopene; memantine; methyl CpG binding protein 2; microRNA; ml 004; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; nti 164; nti 164 compoud; oxiracetam; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor binding protein; Prangos ferulacea extract; propionic acid; protein Bax; romidepsin; sb 121; serotonin; serotonin uptake inhibitor; unclassified drug; valproic acid; zinc; apoptosis; artificial intelligence; assistive technology; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; Autism tracker pro; Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist; behavior disorder; Birdhouse for autism; brain development; Childhood Autism Rating Scale; communication disorder; communication skill; copy number variation; DNA methylation; embryonic stem cell; emotional network; environmental change; epigenetic modification; epigenetics; fetal stem cell; fetus development; gene; genetic analysis; histone modification; HOXA1 gene; human; hypoxia; immunological tolerance; impulsiveness; induced pluripotent stem cell; intellectual impairment; intelligence quotient; machine learning; manatee app; maternal infection; medical education; mesenchymal stem cell; Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddler; morbidity; mortality; motor performance; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nervous system inflammation; neuronal connection; neuronal development; neurorehabilitation; NLGN3 gene; NLGN4 gene; nonhuman; NRXN1 gene; oxidative stress; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical activity; physical performance; Proloquo 2 go; Review; RNA processing; SHANK3 gene; social interaction; stem cell transplantation; Total Autism Risk and Treatment Score; umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell; Visual schedules and social stories; child; female; genetics; male; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Female; Humans; Male","","4 aminobutyric acid, 28805-76-7, 56-12-2; adenylate cyclase, 9012-42-4; agmatine, 306-60-5; canagliflozin, 842133-18-0, 928672-86-0; cyclic AMP, 60-92-4; docosahexaenoic acid, 25167-62-8, 32839-18-2; dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; fenofibrate, 49562-28-9; fingolimod, 162359-56-0, 162359-55-9, 1967800-35-6; glutamate acetyltransferase, 37257-14-0; histone deacetylase, 9076-57-7; homotaurine, 3687-18-1; lycopene, 502-65-8; memantine, 19982-08-2, 41100-52-1, 51052-62-1; n methyl dextro aspartic acid, 6384-92-5; oxiracetam, 62613-82-5; propionic acid, 72-03-7, 79-09-4; romidepsin, 128517-07-7; serotonin, 50-67-9; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6","Pallanti, Stefano, Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs): Beyond the Clinical Definition and Translational Approach, Children, 10, 1, (2023); Autism Spectrum Disorder Investigating Predictive Diagnostic Relationships in Children Three Years of Age and Younger, (2018); Lord, Catherine E., Autism spectrum disorder, The Lancet, 392, 10146, pp. 508-520, (2018); Masi, Anne, An Overview of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Heterogeneity and Treatment Options, Neuroscience Bulletin, 33, 2, pp. 183-193, (2017); Newschaffer, Craig J., The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders, Annual Review of Public Health, 28, pp. 235-258, (2007); Bolton, Patrick Farrar, Epilepsy in autism: Features and correlates, British Journal of Psychiatry, 198, 4, pp. 289-294, (2011); Gładysz, Dominika, Immune Abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder—Could They Hold Promise for Causative Treatment?, Molecular Neurobiology, 55, 8, pp. 6387-6435, (2018); How Common are Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children with Autism, (2003); Krakowiak, Paula, Sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorders, developmental delays, and typical development: A population-based study, Journal of Sleep Research, 17, 2, pp. 197-206, (2008); Cureus, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15734978; 03014851","","MLBRB","38704762","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192105339"

Methods: Three driving circuits of progressive difficulty levels (C1, C2, C3) that were elaborated to assess the driving performances with PWC in indoor situations, were used in this study. These circuits have been modeled in a 3D Virtual Environment to replicate the three driving task scenarios in Virtual Reality (VR). Users were asked to complete the three circuits with respect to two testing conditions during three successive sessions, i.e. in VR and on a real circuit (R). During each session, users completed the two conditions. Driving performances were evaluated using the number of collisions and time to complete the circuit. In addition, driving ability by Wheelchair Skill Test (WST) and mental load were assessed in both conditions. Cybersickness, user satisfaction and sense of presence were measured in VR. The conditions R and VR were randomized. Results: Thirty-one participants with neurological disorders and expert wheelchair drivers were included in the study. The driving performances between VR and R conditions were statistically different for the C3 circuit but were not statistically different for the two easiest circuits C1 and C2. The results of the WST was not statistically different in C1, C2 and C3. The mental load was higher in VR than in R condition. The general sense of presence was reported as acceptable (mean value of 4.6 out of 6) for all the participants, and the cybersickness was reported as acceptable (SSQ mean value of 4.25 on the three circuits in VR condition). Conclusion: Driving performances were statistically different in the most complicated circuit C3 with an increased number of collisions in VR, but were not statistically different for the two easiest circuits C1 and C2 in R and VR conditions. In addition, there were no significant adverse effects such as cybersickness. The results show the value of the simulator for driving training applications. Still, the mental load was higher in VR than in R condition, thus mitigating the potential for use with people with cognitive disorders. Further studies should be conducted to assess the quality of skill transfer for novice drivers from the simulator to the real world.

It examines the types of robotics technologies employed, their applications, and the gaps in the existing literature. Our scoping review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. The systematic search of relevant databases allowed us to identify studies that use robotics technologies for fostering social, emotional, and cognitive skills in young children with autism. Our review has revealed that various robots, such as Nao, Kaspar, and Zeno, have been used to support the development of social and emotional skills through imitation games, turn-taking, joint attention, emotional recognition, and conversation. As most of these studies were conducted in clinical settings, there is a need for further research in classroom and community-based environments. Additionally, the literature calls for more high-quality longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of robot-assisted therapy and to assess adaptive and personalised interventions tailored to individual needs. More emphasis is recommended on professional development for educators, parents, and health professionals to incorporate robotics technologies as evidence-based interventions as a pathway for creating inclusive learning environments for children with autism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism spectrum disorder; Child-robot interactions; Inclusive teaching and learning; Robot-assisted therapy; Robotics technologies","Article; autism; caregiver; child; comparative study; conceptual framework; conversation; data analysis; data base; data extraction; disease duration; emotional support; emotional well-being; evidence based practice; health practitioner; home environment; human; imitation; learning; learning environment; longitudinal study; Medline; meta analysis; nonverbal communication; practice guideline; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; professional development; robotics; self advocacy; signal transduction; skill; social competence; social interaction; social norm; social support; social well-being; stress management; systematic review; emotion; preschool child; procedures; psychology; social learning; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Emotions; Humans; Learning; Robotics; Social Learning; Social Skills","","","Alb́o-Canals, Jordi, A Pilot Study of the KIBO Robot in Children with Severe ASD, International Journal of Social Robotics, 10, 3, pp. 371-383, (2018); Anzalone, Salvatore Maria, Evaluating the Engagement with Social Robots, International Journal of Social Robotics, 7, 4, pp. 465-478, (2015); Baldassarri, Sandra, Toward emotional interactive videogames for children with autism spectrum disorder, Universal Access in the Information Society, 20, 2, pp. 239-254, (2021); Begum, Momotaz, Are Robots Ready to Deliver Autism Interventions?

Of the sixteen reviewed studies, ten were focused on dyslexia, with only one focused on dyscalculia and the remaining focused on learning disabilities in general. The study suggests that only 50% of studies focused on school-age children. Seven types of AI applications were used to support SWLDs, including adaptive learning, facial expression, chat robot, communication assistant, mastery learning, intelligent tutor, and interactive robot. The adaptive learning was the most widely used. Employing the SAMR-LD (i.e., substitute, augment, modify, and redefine-learning disability) model, we found that AI had been utilized in various ways to support SWLDs (four substitutions, six augmentations, two modifications, and four redefinition levels). Findings revealed the potential of AI in supporting SWLDs, but the small number of empirical studies also implies significant gaps and the need for more research on how AI can support SWLDs beyond just identifying and diagnosing a learning disability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive learning; Artificial intelligence (AI); Dyscalculia; Dyslexia; Learning disabilities; SAMR-LD","","","","Abdul Hamid, Siti Suhaila, Engagement prediction in the adaptive learning model for students with dyslexia, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Part F137694, pp. 66-73, (2018); Abdul Hamid, Siti Suhaila, Dyslexia adaptive learning model: Student engagement prediction using machine learning approach, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 700, pp. 372-384, (2018); Asghar, Anila, Learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics: Supporting Students with Learning Disabilities, Canadian Psychology, 58, 3, pp. 238-249, (2017); Büttner, Gerhard, Learning Disabilities: Debates on definitions, causes, subtypes, and responses, International Journal of Disability, Development and Education, 58, 1, pp. 75-87, (2011); Drigas, Athanasios S., Artificial intelligence in special education: A decade review, International Journal of Engineering Education, 28, 6, pp. 1366-1372, (2012); Drigas, Athanasios S., A Review on Artificial Intelligence in Special Education, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 278, pp. 385-391, (2013); Flogie, Andrej, Development and evaluation of intelligent serious games for children with learning difficulties: Observational study, JMIR Serious Games, 8, 2, (2020); Gupta, Ravisha, Adaptive testing tool for students with dyslexia, pp. 11-16, (2019); Gupta, Sambhav, Supporting Inclusive Learning Using Chatbots?

One of the early intervention models recommended by the French National Authority for Health is the Early Start Denver Model, an individualised, intensive programme based on play activities chosen by the child. While studies published in recent years suggest that robots provide benefits for autistic children in learning social interactions within a clinical setting, there is no scientific consensus on the widespread contribution and maintenance of their effects over time. On the other hand, a robotic solution controlled directly by a practitioner (ie, on-site telepresence system) enables greater adaptability to children's responses and choices during interventions. We believe that such a solution would enable better assessment of progress in the fundamental skills of expressive communication and imitation as well as greater engagement during interventions. Methods and analysis This is a prospective, monocentric, descriptive and evaluative pilot study based on single-case experimental design (SCED) methodology. The study will recruit eight children diagnosed with ASD aged between 2 and 5 years. The intervention will take place 15 min after the usual weekly care. The SCED methodology is constructed in three stages: (A) 4 weekly sessions at baseline without the robot, (B) 9 weekly sessions with intervention modification using a social robot as cotherapist and (C) 4 weekly sessions without the robot for follow-up. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the South East IV Ethics Committee (CPP Sud-Est IV) (number: 2023-A00895-40) in France. Explicit consent is required from all legal representatives (parents) of children participating in this study. We aim to disseminate the results of this study through national and international conferences, international peer-reviewed journals and social media. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child & adolescent psychiatry; EPIDEMIOLOGY; Virtual Reality","anonymised data; Article; audio recording; auditory feedback; autism; biostatistician; child; clinical article; communication skill; consensus; controlled study; data completeness; data quality; early intervention; experimental design; feedback system; follow up; human; imitation; internal validity; interpersonal communication; methodology; motivation; PhD student; physician; pilot study; protocol; questionnaire; satisfaction; scientific literature; single-case study; social engagement; social interaction; social learning; speech; videorecording; early childhood intervention; female; male; preschool child; procedures; prospective study; psychology; robotics; therapy; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child, Preschool; Communication; Early Intervention, Educational; Female; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Research Design; Robotics; Single-Case Studies as Topic; Social Interaction","","","Zeidan, Jinan, Global prevalence of autism: A systematic review update, Autism Research, 15, 5, pp. 778-790, (2022); Foxx, Richard M., Applied Behavior Analysis Treatment of Autism: The State of the Art, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 17, 4, pp. 821-834, (2008); Dawson, Geraldine, Early behavioral intervention is associated with normalized brain activity in young children with autism, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 51, 11, pp. 1150-1159, (2012); Early Start Denver Model for Young Children with Autism Promoting Language Learning and Engagement, (2010); Geoffray, Marie Maude, Using ESDM 12 hours per week in children with autism spectrum disorder: feasibility and results of an observational study, Psychiatria Danubina, 31, 3, pp. 333-339, (2019); Christensen, Deborah L., Prevalence and characteristics of autism spectrum disorder among 4-year-old children in the autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 37, 1, pp. 1-8, (2016); Cabibihan, John John, Why Robots?

As these technologies continue to advance, ensuring user-friendly interfaces and seamless interactions becomes more essential. For social robots to genuinely provide lasting value to humans, a favourable user experience (UX) emerges as an essential prerequisite. This article aimed to evaluate the usability of the MINI robot, highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement based on user feedback and performance. Materials and Methods: In a controlled lab setting, a mixed-method qualitative study was conducted with ten individuals aged 65 and above diagnosed with mild dementia (MD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants engaged in individual MINI robot interaction sessions, completing cognitive tasks as per written instructions. Video and audio recordings documented interactions, while post-session System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaires quantified usability perception. Ethical guidelines were followed, ensuring informed consent, and the data underwent qualitative and quantitative analyses, contributing insights into the MINI robot’s usability for this demographic. Results: The study addresses the ongoing challenges that tasks present, especially for MD individuals, emphasizing the importance of user support. Most tasks require both verbal and physical interactions, indicating that MD individuals face challenges when switching response methods within subtasks. These complexities originate from the selection and use of response methods, including difficulties with voice recognition, tablet touch, and tactile sensors. These challenges persist across tasks, with individuals with MD struggling to comprehend task instructions and provide correct answers and individuals with MCI struggling to use response devices, often due to the limitations of the robot’s speech recognition. Technical shortcomings have been identified. The results of the SUS indicate positive perceptions, although there are lower ratings for instructor assistance and pre-use learning. The average SUS score of 68.3 places device usability in the “good” category. Conclusions: Our study examines the usability of the MINI robot, revealing strengths in quick learning, simple system and operation, and integration of features, while also highlighting areas for improvement. Careful design and modifications are essential for meaningful engagement with people with dementia. The robot could better benefit people with MD and MCI if clear, detailed instructions and instructor assistance were available. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dementia; mild cognitive impairments; social robots; usability; user experience","Audio recordings; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Microrobots; Neurodegenerative diseases; Robot learning; Usability engineering; Cognitive impairment; Dementia; Elderly adults; Mild cognitive impairment; Mild dementia; Robots for elderlies; Social robots; System usability; Usability; Users' experiences; aged; cognitive defect; computer interface; dementia; female; human; male; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; robotics; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Male; Robotics; Surveys and Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface","","","Current Robotics Reports, (2021); Gerlowska, Justyna, Assessment of perceived attractiveness, usability, and societal impact of a multimodal Robotic Assistant for aging patients with memory impairments, Frontiers in Neurology, 9, JUN, (2018); Amanatiadis, Angelos A., Interactive social robots in special education, IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin, ICCE-Berlin, 2017-September, pp. 126-129, (2017); Shourmasti, Elaheh Shahmir, User experience in social robots, Sensors, 21, 15, (2021); Reich-Stiebert, Natalia, Learning with Educational Companion Robots?

This review explores the current landscape and future prospects of AI technologies in ASD diagnostics and interventions. AI enables early detection and personalized assessment of ASD through the analysis of diverse data sources such as behavioural patterns, neuroimaging, genetics, and electronic health records. Machine learning algorithms exhibit high accuracy in distinguishing ASD from neurotypical development and other developmental disorders, facilitating timely interventions. Furthermore, AI-driven therapeutic interventions, including augmentative communication systems, virtual reality-based training, and robot-assisted therapies, show potential in improving social interactions and communication skills in individuals with ASD. Despite challenges such as data privacy and interpretability, the future of AI in ASD holds promise for refining diagnostic accuracy, deploying telehealth platforms, and tailoring treatment plans. By harnessing AI, clinicians can enhance ASD care delivery, empower patients, and advance our understanding of this complex condition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; ASD; Data handling; Genetic markers; Neuroimaging; Virtual reality","biological marker; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cytokine; oxytocin; protein S100B; reelin; somatomedin C; artificial intelligence; augmentative and alternative communication; augmented reality; autism; behavior assessment; communication skill; convolutional neural network; cortical thickness (brain); data privacy; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; early diagnosis; electronic health record; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; genetic marker; human; information processing; learning algorithm; long short term memory network; machine learning; morphometry; neuroimaging; Review; robot assisted surgery; social competence; social interaction; telehealth; training; treatment planning; virtual reality; diagnosis; telemedicine; therapy; Artificial Intelligence; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Humans; Telemedicine","","brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; oxytocin, 50-56-6, 54577-94-5; protein S100B, 357701-89-4; somatomedin C, 67763-96-6","Al- Ayadhi, Laila Yousef, Behavioral benefits of camel milk in subjects with autism spectrum disorder, Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan, 25, 11, pp. 819-823, (2015); Albahri, A.

Leveraging this feature, we engineered an exoskeleton, called DexteriSync, that can dynamically adjust the user's finger dexterity and induce different thermal perceptions by modulating finger skin temperature. This exoskeleton comprises flexible silicone-copper tube segments, 3D-printed finger sockets, a 3D-printed palm base, a pump system, and a water temperature control with a storage unit. By realising an embodied experience of compromised dexterity, DexteriSync can help product designers understand the lived experience of compromised hand dexterity, such as that of the elderly and/or neurodivergent users, when designing daily necessities for them. We validated DexteriSync via a technical evaluation and two user studies, demonstrating that it can change skin temperature, dexterity, and thermal perception. An exploratory session with design students and an autistic compromised dexterity individual, demonstrated the exoskeleton provided a more realistic experience compared to video education, and allowed them to gain higher confidence in their designs. The results advocated for the efficacy of experiencing embodied compromised finger dexterity, which can promote an understanding of the related physical challenges and lead to a more persuasive design for assistive tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dexterity; embodied interaction; hand exoskeleton; thermal perception","Hand tools; Physiological models; Dexterity; Embodied interaction; Finger skin; Hand exoskeleton; Human hands; Morphing; Physiological factors; Skin temperatures; Thermal; Thermal perception; Exoskeleton (Robotics)","","","Akazue, Moses, The effect of thermal stimuli on the emotional perception of images, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 4401-4412, (2016); Arata, Jumpei, A new hand exoskeleton device for rehabilitation using a three-layered sliding spring mechanism, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3902-3907, (2013); Arens, Edward A., The skin's role in human thermoregulation and comfort, pp. 560-602, (2006); Barrocas, Roberta, Design and empirical evaluation of a multitouch interaction game-like app for fostering early embodied math learning, International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 175, (2023); A Physiological Study of Heating and Ventilation, (1936); Bell, Martin P.D., Interaction between muscle temperature and contraction velocity affects mechanical efficiency during moderate-intensity cycling exercise in young and older women, Journal of Applied Physiology, 107, 3, pp. 763-769, (2009); Bokiniec, Phil, The neural circuits of thermal perception, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 52, pp. 98-106, (2018); Brajkovic, Dragan, Finger dexterity, skin temperature, and blood flow during auxiliary heating in the cold, Journal of Applied Physiology, 95, 2, pp. 758-770, (2003); Braun, Niclas, The senses of agency and ownership: A review, Frontiers in Psychology, 9, APR, (2018); Baeumler, Petra I., Strong and aversive cold processing and pain facilitation in fibromyalgia patients relates to augmented thermal grill illusion, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGGRAPH","37th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, UIST 2024","","Pittsburgh; PA","204160","","9798400706288","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215102496"

However, the lack of objective assessment tools as well as the difficulty to administer them to children under five retards autism detection and subsequent intervention. High-functioning autism individuals often exhibit functional deficits, not readily apparent, which deteriorate their quality of life and that of their families. The employment of technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Robotics holds promises regarding objective autism assessment and high-functioning assessment in particular. In this study, a dataset gathered in a previous study was utilised aiming to classify high-functioning autistic adults engaged in web-browsing tasks: a Browse and a Search one. Various machine learning algorithms were implemented resulting in increased high-functioning autism classification accuracy, i.e., 71.9% and 71.4% for the Browse and Search tasks respectively. This methodology could enhance autism research regarding increased autism classification accuracy and objective and less expensive autism assessment. The limitations encountered and future scope for research are presented, as well. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Nervous Child, (1943); Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Klin, Ami J., Social visual engagement in infants and toddlers with autism: Early developmental transitions and a model of pathogenesis, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 50, pp. 189-203, (2015); Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, (2025); Lord, Catherine E., Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised: A revised version of a diagnostic interview for caregivers of individuals with possible pervasive developmental disorders, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 24, 5, pp. 659-685, (1994); Proceedings of the 17th International Web for all Conference W4a20, (2020); Wiggins, Lisa D., Examination of the time between first evaluation and first autism spectrum diagnosis in a population-based sample, Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 27, 2 SUPPL. 2, pp. S79-S87, (2006); Murphy, Clodagh M., Autism spectrum disorder in adults: Diagnosis, management, and health services development, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 12, pp. 1669-1686, (2016); Zhu, Fenglei, A multimodal machine learning system in early screening for toddlers with autism spectrum disorders based on the response to name, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 14, (2023); Barik, Kasturi, A Fusion-Based Machine Learning Approach for Autism Detection in Young Children Using Magnetoencephalography Signals, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 53, 12, pp. 4830-4848, (2023)","Roy, D.; Fragulis, G.","American Institute of Physics","","6th International Conference Series on ICT, Entertainment Technologies, and Intelligent Information Management in Education and Industry, ETLTC 2024","","Hybrid, Aizuwakamatsu","203186","0094243X; 15517616","9780735446496; 9780735451889; 9780735441088; 9780735403598; 9780735444577; 9780735443594; 9780735448001; 9780735416437; 9780735402744; 9780735408869","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207235554"

The integration of robotics in autism therapy has shown significant promise in enhancing social, communicative, and cognitive skills in children with ASD. Developing a robot for autism therapy involves a structured design-based research (DBR) process to ensure the robot effectively meets the needs of children with autism. Social robots are designed to interact with children in a way that is engaging and supportive, helping to improve skills such as eye contact, emotional recognition, and joint attention. These robots utilize advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to adapt to the individual needs of each child, providing personalized therapeutic interventions. Studies have demonstrated that robots can effectively reduce social anxiety and improve social interactions among children with ASD, making therapy sessions more enjoyable and effective. Moreover, robots offer a consistent and repeatable means of delivering therapy, which can be beneficial in standardizing treatment protocols. The use of robotics also allows for the collection of precise data on the child's responses and progress, facilitating more accurate assessments and adjustments to therapy plans. As research continues to evolve, the potential for robots to become a standard tool in autism therapy becomes increasingly feasible, offering a promising adjunct to traditional therapeutic methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Autistic spectrum; Robot; Social interaction; Therapy","","","","Asean Journal of Science and Engineering Education, (2022); Asean Journal of Science and Engineering Education, (2022); Khaleel, Hind Zuhair, Measurement Enhancement of Ultrasonic Sensor using Pelican Optimization Algorithm for Robotic Application, Indonesian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, 1, pp. 145-162, (2024); Al-Obaidi, Abdulkareem Sh Mahdi, Embedded design and implementation of mobile robot for surveillance applications, Indonesian Journal of Science and Technology, 6, 2, pp. 427-440, (2021); Castiblanco, Paola Andrea, Smart materials and their application in robotic hand systems: A state of the art, Indonesian Journal of Science and Technology, 6, 2, pp. 401-426, (2021); Indonesian Journal of Community and Special Needs Education, (2021); Indonesian Journal of Multidiciplinary Research, (2022); Indonesian Journal of Community and Special Needs Education, (2024); Asia Pacific Journal of Developmental Differences, (2018); Pashevich, Ekaterina, Can communication with social robots influence how children develop empathy?

Methods: We searched four databases (PubMed, IEEXplore, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library) to find relevant reviews on clinical applications of ICTs with individuals with NDD. We extracted all studies (n = 1879) from 301 reviews, and classified them into categories: robots, serious games (SG), video modeling (VM), Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). We randomly assessed 182 studies (45 per ICT category) stratified by years of publication using the Connolly methodology scale and design ICT inventory (DICTI). We also described the best papers per ICT (most cited or highest impact factor journals). Results: Our assessments have indicated that the overall research methodology quality of ICT studies is poor. Serious Games (SG) studies have the best research methodology and ICT design quality scores. Studies on robots, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), and video modeling (VM) have shown improved research methodology over the years, though only SG design shown improvement consistently. Autism is the most prevalent NDD in terms of clinical focus in ICT therapeutic and educational interventions. Currently, no ICT has been approved as a prescription treatment in NDD, with the notable exception of EndeavorRx™, a SG for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The literature also emphasizes that meeting the main research methodology criteria is essential for evidence-based medicine, Personalization, adaptability, positive feedback, human interaction and affordability are among the most important features to take into consideration in ICT design for NDD. Conclusion: The review highlights the need for higher-quality studies, user-friendly technologies, personalization, positive feedback, and accessibility. ICTs are not detrimental to learning and demonstrate potential benefits for individuals with NDD. However, more evidence-based studies are needed to reach treatment prescription recommendation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design; ICT; Metareview; Methodology; Neurodevelopmental disorders","academic achievement; adaptation; anxiety; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; augmentative and alternative communication; autism; child; communication disorder; communication technology; developmental disorder; dyslexia; evidence based medicine; executive function; game; health care; human; human relation; information retrieval; intellectual impairment; interrater reliability; journal impact factor; learning disorder; library; Medline; mental disease; methodology; motor performance; personal autonomy; positive feedback; publication; Review; Scopus; serious game; social competence; stereotyping; systematic review; technology; usability; virtual reality","","","Allen, Melissa L., iPads and the use of ""apps"" by children with autism spectrum disorder: Do they promote learning?, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, AUG, (2016); undefined, (2015); An, Sainan, Development and evaluation of a speech-generating AAC mobile app for minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder in Mainland China, Molecular Autism, 8, 1, (2017); Arim, Rubab G., Children with neurodevelopmental disorders and disabilities: a population-based study of healthcare service utilization using administrative data, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 59, 12, pp. 1284-1290, (2017); International Journal of Adult Vocational Education and Technology Ijavet, (2016); Benton, Laura, Widening participation in technology design: A review of the involvement of children with special educational needs and disabilities, International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, 3-4, pp. 23-40, (2015); Börjesson, Peter, Designing technology for and with developmentally diverse children - A systematic literature review, pp. 79-88, (2015); Boucenna, Sofiane, Interactive Technologies for Autistic Children: A Review, Cognitive Computation, 6, 4, pp. 722-740, (2014); Mental Health Weekly, (2020); Carlier, Stephanie, Empowering children with ASD and their parents: Design of a serious game for anxiety and stress reduction†, Sensors, 20, 4, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","17509467; 18780237","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205729034"

Early intensive sensorimotor rehabilitation has been shown to change brain structure and reduce CP symptoms severity. We combined environmental enrichment (EE) and treadmill training (TT) to observe the effects of a one-week program of sensorimotor stimulation (EETT) in animals exposed to a CP model and explored possible mechanisms involved in the functional recovery. Methods: Pregnant Wistar rats were injected with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS − 200 µg/kg) intraperitoneally at embryonic days 18 and 19. At P0, pups of both sexes were exposed to 20′ anoxia at 37 °C. From P2 to P21, hindlimbs were restricted for 16 h/day during the dark cycle. EETT lasted from P21 to P27. TT − 15 min/day at 7 cm/s. EE − 7 days in enriched cages with sensorimotor stimulus. Functional 3D kinematic gait analysis and locomotion were analyzed. At P28, brains were collected for ex-vivo MRI and histological assessment. Neurotrophins and key proteins involved in CNS function were assessed by western blotting. Results: CP model caused gross and skilled locomotor disruption and altered CNS neurochemistry. EETT reversed locomotor dysfunction with minor effects over gait kinematics. EETT also decreased brain inflammation and glial activation, preserved myelination, upregulated BDNF signaling and modulated the expression of proteins involved in excitatory synaptic function in the brain and spinal cord.

By harnessing the inherent affinity of children with ASD for robots and technology, RoboCA3T offers a therapeutic environment designed to maximise engagement and facilitate effective skill development. It harnesses the advantages of Robot-Assisted Therapies (RATs) by employing robot avatars and integrating them with Computer-Assisted Therapies (CATs) within a web-based solution. The integration of automatic gaze and pose detection algorithms within RoboCA3T addresses the challenge posed by potential human error and observation bias in assessing the child's progress, thereby ensuring accurate results. This research responds to the need for more effective, technology driven therapies for autism, filling gaps in existing methods. Objectives: The primary goal of this research is to create a robot inspired computer assisted adaptive autism therapy that maximises engagement and enhances joint attention and imitation skills. Methods: The study involves 11 ASD children with 30 sessions (divided into two halves) per module over eight months, comprising 660 experimental trials, 110 familiarizations, and 110 follow-up sessions. The joint attention module evaluates the subject's gaze pattern using WebGazer for gaze detection in response to four least-to-most robot-generated cues. The imitation module utilises robot-generated pose for comparing subjects' imitated actions using Tensorflow Lite for pose estimation. Results and Conclusions: The effectiveness of therapy was substantiated by comparing Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores before and after intervention. Significant improvements were noted between the first and second therapy halves, validated by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (p < 0.01) and spearman's correlation analysis, reinforcing the observed improvements in joint attention and imitation skills. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Computer Assisted Therapy (CAT); imitation; Joint Attention (JA); Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT); web-based therapy","","","","Aguiar, Yuska Paola Costa, AutismGuide: a usability guidelines to design software solutions for users with autism spectrum disorder, Behaviour and Information Technology, 41, 6, pp. 1132-1150, (2022); Aishworiya, Ramkumar, An Update on Psychopharmacological Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Neurotherapeutics, 19, 1, pp. 248-262, (2022); Sial, Sara Baber, An Experimental Trial: Multi-Robot Therapy for Categorization of Autism Level Using Hidden Markov Model, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 60, 3, pp. 722-741, (2022); Sial, Sara Baber, An Adaptive Multi-Robot Therapy for Improving Joint Attention and Imitation of ASD Children, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 81808-81825, (2019); Alsaeedi, Abdullah A., Comparing web accessibility evaluation tools and evaluating the accessibility of webpages: Proposed frameworks, Information (Switzerland), 11, 1, (2020); Alshammari, Rafeef Fauzi Najim, Robotics Utilization in Automatic Vision-Based Assessment Systems From Artificial Intelligence Perspective: A Systematic Review, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 77537-77570, (2022); Alshawwa, Samar Zuhair, The most common treatment methods through comparing the studies results of children with autism spectrum syndrome, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences, 11, 2, pp. 155-165, (2023); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2013); American Psychiatric Association, (2022); Ames, Catherine S., A review of methods in the study of attention in autism, Developmental Review, 30, 1, pp. 52-73, (2010)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","02664909; 13652729","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193404299"

During childcare leave, being able to learn in the examination room while staying at home would be useful. Therefore, we developed a training system using a teleoperated robot (Sota) for young psychiatrists who wanted to participate in the examination room during childcare leave while remaining at home. Case Presentation: We report the case of a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comorbid with Tourette's disorders (P). A young female psychiatrist (D) used the training system to learn from a board-certified psychiatrist. In this case, the board-certified psychiatrist, P, and the robot were placed in the examination room. D teleoperated Sota from home, allowing her to talk to the board-certified psychiatrist and P. She learned about the clinical features of Tourette's syndrome by observing the examination of the board-certified psychiatrist and hearing the patient's distress. P was satisfied with the fact that he was seen not only by a board-certified psychiatrist but also by D. Conclusion: These case findings suggest that our system is helpful for young psychiatrists who want to study in the examination room during childcare leave while staying at home. Future studies should include a single-case experimental design with information regarding key outcome variables and other relevant variables gathered regularly over time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","board-certified psychiatrist; childcare leave; clinical training; early career; examination room","","","","Franzoi, Isabella Giulia, Returning to work after maternity leave: a systematic literature review, Archives of Women's Mental Health, 27, 5, pp. 737-749, (2024); Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi, (2019); Akiyoshi, Takuto, A Robot That Encourages Self-Disclosure to Reduce Anger Mood, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 6, 4, pp. 7926-7933, (2021); Baba, Jun, Local vs. Avatar Robot: Performance and Perceived Workload of Service Encounters in Public Space, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 8, (2021); Nakanishi, Junya, Continuous Hospitality with Social Robots at a hotel, SN Applied Sciences, 2, 3, (2020); Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Leekam, Susan R., The Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders: Algorithms for ICD-10 childhood autism and Wing and Gould autistic spectrum disorders, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 43, 3, pp. 327-342, (2002); Wing, Lorna, The Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders: Background, inter-rater reliability and clinical use, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 43, 3, pp. 307-325, (2002); Kumazaki, Hirokazu, Optimal robot for intervention for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 74, 11, pp. 581-586, (2020); Pennisi, Paola, Autism and social robotics: A systematic review, Autism Research, 9, 2, pp. 165-183, (2016)","","Blackwell Publishing Asia","","","","","","27692558","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203364482"

There is insufficient evidence documenting the qualitative impact of such programmes on social development and participation of children with autism spectrum disorder. This study aimed to identify the qualitative outcomes of a robot-mediated social skills training programme for children with autism spectrum disorder, examine the impact of such programmes on children’s social participation and identify the essential elements of robotic interventions that are conducive to children’s social development. A case study approach with a multiple case study design was adopted. Sixteen children with autism spectrum disorder, aged 5–11 years, were included. Participants received 12 weekly sessions of robot-mediated social skills training. The successful outcomes relating to social participation were identified as enhanced verbal expression, social awareness and emotional reciprocity. The impacts of the programme on personal development were identified as enhanced self-esteem, self-confidence and emotional expression. Robot friendship, the role of the robot as a facilitator and the presence of a human instructor capable of leading the programme were identified as essential elements of the positive changes. The encounter with a social robot was regarded as meaningful and important to the children with autism spectrum disorder. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism; Canadian Occupational Performance Measure; participation; social development; Social robotics","","","","Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Anzalone, Salvatore Maria, How children with autism spectrum disorder behave and explore the 4-dimensional (spatial 3D + time) environment during a joint attention induction task with a robot, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 8, 7, pp. 814-826, (2014); Bauminger-Zviely, Nirit, Children with autism and their friends: A multidimensional study of friendship in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder, Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 36, 2, pp. 135-150, (2008); Borenstein, Jason, Companion robots and the emotional development of children, Law, Innovation and Technology, 5, 2, pp. 172-189, (2013); Chevalier, Pauline, Examining joint attention with the use of humanoid robots-A new approach to study fundamental mechanisms of social cognition, Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 27, 2, pp. 217-236, (2020); Chung, Eva Yin Han, Robot-Mediated Social Skill Intervention Programme for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An ABA Time-Series Study, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 5, pp. 1095-1107, (2021); Costa, Sandra C., Using a Humanoid Robot to Elicit Body Awareness and Appropriate Physical Interaction in Children with Autism, International Journal of Social Robotics, 7, 2, pp. 265-278, (2015); Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2013); Cusick, Anne, Adapting the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure for use in a paediatric clinical trial, Disability and Rehabilitation, 29, 10, pp. 761-766, (2007); Dalemans, Ruth J.P., Measures for rating social participation in people with aphasia: A systematic review, Clinical Rehabilitation, 22, 6, pp. 542-555, (2008)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","03080226; 14776006","","BJOTB","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193924064"

A uniform oval-shaped structure was considered for the design, featuring two arms, leg-like wheels, and a facial screen for displaying facial expressions. Six basic emotional states were generated, enriched with facial expressions, colors, sounds, and movements, aiming to emulate human nonverbal language to the greatest extent possible. The construction process was executed using additive manufacturing technology, specifically 3D printing. Once the functional prototype was developed, its appearance, therapeutic usability, generation of emotional states, and social skill development were evaluated through structured surveys on a Likert Scale. The evaluation took place in two stages: (a) expert peer evaluation, involving 5 experts in ASD, with consensus levels determined using Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (ω), that show a susbtantial agreement (ω=0.709) regarding the robot appearance and slight agreement (ω=0.183) in mood generation; (b) perception assessment with individuals who work daily with people with ASD, with 36 participants, and survey validation through Cronbach’s Alpha (α=0.94), followed by results analysis using descriptive statistics, which indicates that the robot appearance is suitable for the majority of evaluators, but they differ in the robot dimensions. Outcomes highlighted the robotic assistant’s specific characteristics that warrant adjustments before piloting with ASD individuals. This study presents a replicable protocol for the preliminary evaluation of any technological support geared towards therapeutic interventions, preceding experimental processes involving the target audience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism spectrum disorder; Emotional learning; Experimental assessment; Robot assistant; Social skills; Therapeutic intervention","3D printing; Economic and social effects; Machine design; Autism spectrum disorders; Emotional learning; Emotional state; Experimental assessment; Facial Expressions; Robot appearance; Robot assistant; Robotic assistants; Social skills; Therapeutic intervention; Robots","","","Hill, Elisabeth L., Executive dysfunction in autism, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8, 1, pp. 26-32, (2004); Revista De Neurologia, (2011); Autismo Estado Del Arte, (2003); Revista De Educacion Inclusiva, (2016); Elsabbagh, M., Global Prevalence of Autism and Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Autism Research, 5, 3, pp. 160-179, (2012); 2008 on Jstor, (2008); Khowaja, Kamran, Augmented reality for learning of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): A systematic review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 78779-78807, (2020); Jaliaawala, Muhammad Shoaib, Can autism be catered with artificial intelligence-assisted intervention technology?

The primary aim was to evaluate and compare the use of machine learning in neuropsychological research in contrast to traditional approaches such as through case studies. This was achieved by referring to earlier studies on this subject. This article presented the use of support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detecting and predicting neuropsychological diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Challenges in using these models include data availability, quality, variability, model interpretability, and validation. Experimental findings have demonstrated the potential of these models in this field. It has been shown that SVM models are robust and efficient in processing and classifying data, particularly in neuroimaging applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CNNs have excelled in handling visual input; thus, they have been used in neuroimaging segregation, recognition, and classification, with applications in brain tumor segmentation, radiation therapy, robotic neurosurgery, and disease prediction. Future research will explore asymmetric differences among left- and right-handed patients, incorporate longitudinal studies, and utilize larger sample sizes. The use of machine learning models has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychological diseases, allowing for early detection and intervention. This approach could offer significant advantages to healthcare, such as cost-effective diagnosis and treatment, to help save lives and preserve the quality of life of patients. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolution neural network; Machine learning; Neuropsychological; Support vector machine","Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Diagnosis; Disease control; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Neurosurgery; Brain cancer; Convolution neural network; Loss of life; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Multiple sclerosis; Neuropsychological; Quality of life; Support vectors machine; Traditional approaches; Support vector machines; biological marker; adult; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; artificial intelligence; autism; automation; brain cancer; cerebrovascular accident; clinical decision support system; clinical dementia rating scale; cognition; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; dementia; electric potential; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; epilepsy; facial recognition; female; follow up; Fourier transform; health care system; human; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; long short term memory network; machine learning; male; mental disease; Mini Mental State Examination; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; neuropsychological assessment; neuroradiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; prediction; public health; quality of life; regenerative medicine; Review; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; single nucleotide polymorphism; support vector machine; visual field","","","McCarthy, Rosaleen A., Cognitive neuropsychology: A clinical introduction, Brain and Nerve, 48, 10, (1996); Chandler, Chelsea, Machine learning for ambulatory applications of neuropsychological testing, Intelligence-Based Medicine, 1-2, (2020); Experimental Methods in Neuropsychology, (2003); Parsons, Thomas D., Clinical neuropsychology and technology: What's new and how we can use it, pp. 1-190, (2016); Heaton, Robert K., Potential Versus Current Reality of Automation in Neuropsychology: Reply to Kleinmuntz, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 55, 2, pp. 268-269, (1987); Lee, Garam, Predicting Alzheimer’s disease progression using multi-modal deep learning approach, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Bowman, Marilyn Laura, The perfidy of percentiles, Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 17, 3, pp. 295-303, (2002); undefined; J Neuroth, (2012); Lavecchia, Antonio, Deep learning in drug discovery: opportunities, challenges and future prospects, Drug Discovery Today, 24, 10, pp. 2017-2032, (2019)","","Chinese Medical Association","","","","","","20969376; 26671026","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186069424"

It has also been used to disconnect brain tissue in more extensive or diffuse epilepsy, such as corpus callosotomy and hemispherotomy. Methods: In this study, we report a case of temporo-parieto-occipital disconnection surgery performed using MRIgLITT assisted by a robotic arm for refractory epilepsy of the posterior quadrant. A highly realistic cadaver simulation was performed before the actual surgery. Results: The patient was a 14-year-old boy whose seizures began at the age of 8. The epilepsy was a result of a left perinatal ischemic event that caused a porencephalic cyst, and despite receiving multiple antiepileptic drugs, the patient continued to experience daily seizures which led to the recommendation of surgery. Conclusions: A Wada test lateralized language in the right hemisphere. Motor and sensory function was confirmed in the left hemisphere through magnetic resonance imaging functional studies and NexStim. The left MRIgLITT temporo-parieto-occipital disconnection disconnection was achieved using 5 laser fibers. The patient followed an excellent postoperative course and was seizure-free, with no additional neurological deficits 24 months after the surgery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Laser ablation; MRIgLITT; Pediatric epilepsy surgery; Posterior quadrant disconnection; Temporo-parieto-occipital disconnection; TPO","corticosteroid; lacosamide; levetiracetam; oxcarbazepine; perampanel; valproic acid; adolescent; anticonvulsant therapy; Article; cadaver; case report; central sulcus; clinical article; cognitive defect; combination drug therapy; corpus callosum; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; electroencephalogram; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; follow up; functional magnetic resonance imaging; general anesthesia; hemianopia; hemiparesis; hemispheric disconnection; homonymous hemianopia; human; ischemia; laser thermotherapy; learning disorder; left hemisphere; magnetic resonance imaging guided laser interstitial thermal therapy; male; neuroimaging; neuronavigation; neuropsychological assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; parietal bone; patient positioning; polypharmacy; primary motor cortex; processing speed; refractory epilepsy; right hemisphere; robot assisted surgery; simulation; spike wave; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; temporal lobe; thermography; transcranial magnetic stimulation; treatment outcome; working memory; computer assisted surgery; diagnostic imaging; laser therapy; neurosurgery; parietal lobe; procedures; surgery; Adolescent; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Humans; Laser Therapy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurosurgical Procedures; Occipital Lobe; Parietal Lobe; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Temporal Lobe","","lacosamide, 175481-36-4; levetiracetam, 102767-28-2; oxcarbazepine, 28721-07-5; perampanel, 380917-97-5; valproic acid, 1069-66-5, 99-66-1","Daniel, Roy Thomas, Posterior quadrantic epilepsy surgery: Technical variants, surgical anatomy, and case series, Epilepsia, 48, 8, pp. 1429-1437, (2007); de Ribaupierre, Sandrine, Hemispherotomy and other disconnective techniques, Neurosurgical Focus, 25, 3, (2008); Mohamed, Ahmad R., Temporoparietooccipital disconnection in children with intractable epilepsy: Clinical article, Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics, 7, 6, pp. 660-670, (2011); Dorfer, Christian, Disconnective surgery in posterior quadrantic epilepsy: Experience in a consecutive series of 10 patients, Neurosurgical Focus, 34, 6, (2013); Yang, Pengfan, Disconnective surgery in posterior quadrantic epilepsy: A series of 12 paediatric patients, Epileptic Disorders, 16, 3, pp. 296-304, (2014); Rizzi, Michele, Tailored multilobar disconnective epilepsy surgery in the posterior quadrant, Journal of Neurosurgery, 132, 5, pp. 1345-1357, (2020); Limpo, Hiria, A multidisciplinary approach to posterior quadrant disconnective epilepsy surgery in pediatric patients, Neurochirurgie, 69, 6, (2023); Du, Victor X., Laser interstitial thermal therapy: A first line treatment for seizures due to hypothalamic hamartoma?, Epilepsia, 58, pp. 77-84, (2017); Curry, Daniel J., MR-guided laser ablation for the treatment of hypothalamic hamartomas, Epilepsy Research, 142, pp. 131-134, (2018); Candela-Cantó, Santiago, Robot-assisted, real-time, MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy for pediatric patients with hypothalamic hamartoma: surgical technique, pitfalls, and initial results, Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics, 29, 6, pp. 681-692, (2022)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","18788750; 18788769","","","38641246","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192818816"

However, user behaviours use comparable presence to differentiate based on measurement methods and the activities of daily living does not offer step-by-step processes to accomplish the recognition of behavioural stimuli. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes TB-PCNN-FAM method to define an automated machine-based automatic tooth brush assist structure monitor. The TB-PCNN-FAM involves four steps: object detection, object monitoring, misdiagnosis, and completion of the procedure. The sensor data is initially passed to a hierarchical detection framework that computes the current maximum probable behavior for object detection. In a hierarchical detection framework, feature extraction and classification are done. The Curvelet transform method is used to extract the feature which is collected from the sensors. For object monitoring, the extracted features are given to PCNN for user behavior classification. For misdiagnosis, the timing of behavior can be modelled by the FAM. The FAM is appropriate to perfect different states through behavior, which is the validation state and consistency state. To complete the function, a reliable behavioral origin is demonstrated for the user by audio-visual prompt. The proposed technique is implemented in MATLAB. The proposed TB-PCNN-FAM method attains 16.2 %, 21.3 %, 23.3 % higher accuracy and 33.2 %, 25.9 %, 32.4 % better precision when analyzed to the existing models, like Effects of a Caregiver Training Program on Oral Hygiene of Alzheimer's Patients (TB-HIC-ARA), Hybrid force tracking impedance control-based autonomous robotic system (ATB-MPI-GI) and Visual pedagogy‐guided tooth brushing training to improve fine motor skills in individuals(TB-TMGHI-PBI) respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alzheimer patients; Automatic teeth brushing assistance; Cognitive assistive technology (CAT); Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN); User behavior","Feature extraction; MATLAB; Neural networks; Object recognition; Alzheimer patients; Assistive technology; Automatic tooth brushing assistance; Cognitive assistive technology; Object monitoring; Objects detection; Pulse coupled neural network; Tooth brushing; User behaviors; Object detection; Article; cognitive defect; curvelet transform; diagnostic error; feature extraction; finite state machine; human; mentally disabled person; pulse coupled neural network; tooth brushing","","","Feigin, Valery L., The global burden of neurological disorders: translating evidence into policy, The Lancet Neurology, 19, 3, pp. 255-265, (2020); Hildenbrand, Hanna L., Characterizing upper limb function in the context of activities of daily living in CLN3 disease, American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part A, 185, 5, pp. 1399-1413, (2021); Ananda Kumar, K.

Evidence-based neurorehabilitation programs are founded on motor learning principles. The cerebellum is a key neural structure in motor learning. It is unknown whether and how well chronic cerebellar stroke individuals (CCSIs) can learn to coordinate their upper limbs through bimanual motor skill learning. The aim was to determine whether CCSIs could achieve bimanual skill learning through a serious game with the REAplan® robot and to compare CCSIs with healthy individuals (HIs). Over three consecutive days, sixteen CCSIs and eighteen HIs were trained on an asymmetric bimanual coordination task (“CIRCUIT” game) with the REAplan® robot, allowing quantification of speed, accuracy and coordination. The primary outcomes were the bimanual speed/accuracy trade-off (BiSAT) and bimanual coordination factor (BiCo). They were also evaluated on a bimanual REACHING task on Days 1 and 3. Correlation analyses between the robotic outcomes and clinical scale scores were computed. Throughout the sessions, BiSAT and BiCo improved during the CIRCUIT task in both HIs and CCSIs. On Day 3, HIs and CCSIs showed generalization of BiSAT, BiCo and transferred to the REACHING task. There was no significant between-group difference in progression. Four CCSIs and two HIs were categorized as “poor learners” according to BiSAT and/or BiCo. Increasing age correlated with reduced BiSAT but not BiCo progression. Over three days of training, HIs and CCSIs improved, retained, generalized and transferred a coordinated bimanual skill. There was no between-group difference, suggesting plastic compensation in CCSIs.

To address challenges with classical telemedicine for rehabilitation, we propose to use a social robot-augmented telepresence (SRAT), Flo, which was deployed for long-term use in a community-based rehabilitation facility catering to older adults. Our goals were to explore how clinicians and patients would use and respond to the robot during rehab interactions. In this pilot study, three clinicians were recruited and asked to rate usability after receiving training for operating the robot and two of them conducted multiple rehab interactions with their patients using the robot (eleven patients with cognitive impairment and/or motor impairment and 23 rehab sessions delivered via SRAT in total).

The study included 14 CDD aged 10–15. It utilizes a multiple probe design across behaviors and probe conditions and replicates them across subjects. Each participant is taught discrete skills within a small group teaching arrangement. The study includes daily probes, full probes, teaching sessions, generalization, and follow-up sessions. It also collects interobserver reliability and application reliability data. Graphical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of computer-based simultaneous prompting incorporating different technologies in a small group teaching setting. Additionally, we examined differences in children's responses to different technological agents in teaching discrete skills to children with developmental disabilities. The study provided preliminary data on which of these agents is best. The results demonstrate its effectiveness by showing that participants maintained the learned behaviors and applied them to a variety of tools, equipment, and individuals in the first, third, and fourth weeks after the intervention. Additionally, the study highlights the subjects' high accuracy in acquiring behavior through observational learning.

Recently, it has also merged as a promising solution to handle the enormous growth in data and model sizes in deep learning. A fundamental problem in distributed nonconvex optimization is avoiding convergence to saddle points, which significantly degrade optimization accuracy. We find that the process of quantization, which is necessary for all digital communications, can be exploited to enable saddle-point avoidance. More specifically, we propose a stochastic quantization scheme and prove that it can effectively escape saddle points and ensure convergence to a second-order stationary point in distributed nonconvex optimization.

However, when developing new robotics technologies, it must be considered that this condition often causes increased anxiety in unfamiliar settings. Indeed, children with ASD have difficulties accepting changes like introducing multiple new technological devices in their routines, therefore, embedded solutions should be preferred. Also, in this context, robots should be small as children find the bigger ones scary. This leads to limited computing resources onboard as small batteries power them. This article presents a study on gesture recognition using video recorded only by the camera embedded in a NAO robot, while it was leading a clinical procedure. The video is 2D and low quality because of the limits of the NAO-embedded computing resources. The recognition is made more challenging by robot movements, which alter the vision by moving the camera and sometimes by obstructing it with the robot’s arms for short periods. Despite these challenging real-world conditions, in our experiments, we have tuned and improved state-of-the-art algorithms to yield an accuracy higher than 90% in the gesture classification, with the best accuracy being 94%. This level of accuracy is suitable for evaluating the children’s performance and providing information for the diagnosis and continuous assessment of the therapy. We have also considered the performance improvement of using a low-power GPU-AI accelerator embedded system, which could be included in future robots, to enable gesture analysis during the therapy, which could be adapted to the child’s performance.

Due to the wide variety of cognitive abilities and rehabilitation goals, these systems must be flexible to support rapid and accurate implementation of intervention content that is grounded in existing clinical practice. To this end, we detail the system architecture of CARMEN (Cognitively Assistive Robot for Motivation and Neurorehabilitation), a flexible robot system we developed in collaboration with our key stakeholders: clinicians and people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI). We implemented a well-validated compensatory cognitive training (CCT) intervention on CARMEN, which it autonomously delivers to PwMCI. We deployed CARMEN in the homes of these stakeholders to evaluate and gain initial feedback on the system. We found that CARMEN gave participants confidence to use cognitive strategies in their everyday life, and participants saw opportunities for CARMEN to exhibit greater levels of autonomy or be used for other applications. Furthermore, elements of CARMEN are open source to support flexible home-deployed robots. Thus, CARMEN will enable the HRI community to deploy quality interventions to robots, ultimately increasing their accessibility and extensibility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital health interventions; Healthcare robotics; Human robot interaction; Neurorehabilitation; Robot system design; Robotics","Cognitive systems; Machine design; Assistive robots; Clinical interventions; Cognitive impairment; Digital health intervention; Health interventions; Healthcare robotics; Humans-robot interactions; Neurorehabilitation []; Robot system design; Robots system; Human robot interaction","","","Alves-Oliveira, Patrícia, FLEXI: A Robust and Flexible Social Robot Embodiment Kit, pp. 1177-1191, (2022); Arnâiz, Eva, Neuropsychological features of mild cognitive impairment and preclinical Alzheimer's disease, Acta Neurologica Scandinavica, Supplement, 107, 179, pp. 34-41, (2003); Aylett, Matthew Peter, The cere voice characterful speech synthesiser SDK, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4722 LNCS, pp. 413-414, (2007); Bangor, Aaron W., An empirical evaluation of the system usability scale, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 24, 6, pp. 574-594, (2008); Bender, Emily M., On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?, pp. 610-623, (2021); Bhat, Ashwin Sadananda, Plant Robot for At-Home Behavioral Activation Therapy Reminders to Young Adults with Depression, ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction, 10, 3, (2021); Proceedings of We Robot, (2022); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Braun, Virginia, One size fits all?

It is believed that the use of supportive technological mediators can facilitate teaching/learning processes and enable everyone to learn how to critically manage technology without being its slave or passive user while contributing to the collective well-being. Educational robotics is a new frontier for learning that can offer numerous benefits to students. The use of robots can offer the possibility of creating inclusive educational settings in which all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can participate meaningfully. The article proposes an analysis of the evidence obtained from a systematic literature review with reference to general educational robotics and social robotics for emotion recognition. Finally, as a practical implementation of an educational robotic intervention on emotion recognition, the “Emorobot Project” as part of the EU-funded “Ecosystem of Innovation—Technopole of Rome” Project in NextGenerationEU will be presented. The project’s aim is to foster the development of social skills in children with autism spectrum disorders through the creation of an open-source social robot that can recognize emotions. The project is intended to provide teachers with a supportive tool that allows them to design individual activities and later extend the activity to classmates. An educational robot can be used as a social mediator, a playmate during the learning phase that can help students develop social skills, build peer connection, reduce social isolation—one of the main difficulties of this disorder—and foster motivation and the acquisition of interpersonal skills through interaction and imitation. This can help ensure that all students have access to quality education and that no one is left behind. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ASD; education; educational robots; emotion recognition; human-centered robotics; social robots","","","","Form@ Re Open J Per La Form Rete, (2019); Italian Journal of Educational Technology, (2013); undefined; undefined; Petticrew, Mark P., Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences: A Practical Guide, pp. 1-336, (2008); Lindh, Jörgen, Does lego training stimulate pupils' ability to solve logical problems?, Computers and Education, 49, 4, pp. 1097-1111, (2007); Atmatzidou, Soumela, How Does the Degree of Guidance Support Students’ Metacognitive and Problem Solving Skills in Educational Robotics?, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 27, 1, pp. 70-85, (2018); Wang, Kai, The Effectiveness of Educational Robots in Improving Learning Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 5, (2023); Form@re Open J Formazione Rete, (2019); Barker, Bradley S., Robotics as means to increase achievement scores in an informal learning environment, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 39, 3, pp. 229-243, (2007)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277102","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188735403"

However, questions arise regarding the effectiveness of different AI techniques in enhancing therapy for children with specific needs. This review explores current literature on AIBRT for children with disabilities, aiming to understand the efficacy and potential of various AI techniques in improving their therapy. This paper presents a comprehensive search of research articles published from 2019 to September 2023. 39 articles focusing on AI-based robot platforms, the employed treatment or therapy methods, assessment procedures during therapy, and the variables or parameters used to measure intervention effectiveness have been discussed in detail. These AI-based robot platforms have been utilized to engage individuals diagnosed with ASD, offering therapeutic interventions and assessments. In conclusion, the integration of AI and robotics in therapy shows promise for enhancing the development and quality of life for children with disabilities. The findings of this review have implications for therapists, practitioners, and researchers interested in incorporating AI applications into therapy practices. This integration can lead to improved therapy outcomes, optimized children’s development, and enhanced quality of life. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Children with disablities; Precision health; Robot therapy","","","","Seen Counted Included Using Data to Shed Light on the Well Being of Children with Disabilities, (2021); Systematic Review, (2020); Kaelin, Vera Cinzia, Artificial intelligence in rehabilitation targeting the participation of children and youth with disabilities: Scoping review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 23, 11, (2021); Alabdulkareem, Amal, A Systematic Review of Research on Robot-Assisted Therapy for Children with Autism, Sensors, 22, 3, (2022); van den Heuvel, Renée J.F., The potential of robotics for the development and wellbeing of children with disabilities as we see it, Technology and Disability, 34, 1, pp. 25-33, (2022); Verhoef, Ellen, The developmental origins of genetic factors influencing language and literacy: Associations with early-childhood vocabulary, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 62, 6, pp. 728-738, (2021); Lee, Jaeryoung, Social distance in interactions between children with autism and robots, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 22, (2021); Alcorn, Alyssa M., Educators' Views on Using Humanoid Robots With Autistic Learners in Special Education Settings in England, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 6, (2019); Casas, Diego, An open-source social robot based on compliant soft robotics for therapy with children with ASD, Actuators, 9, 3, (2020); Horstmann, Aike C., Important Preliminary Insights for Designing Successful Communication between a Robotic Learning Assistant and Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Germany, Robotics, 11, 6, (2022)","","Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science","","","","","","25024760; 25024752","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185572862"

In this sense, robotics is the tool that can best help the demands of autistic students. Therefore, the aim of the research is to explore the application of robotics by analysing the emotions of autistic children to promote communication and social interaction. To this end, an automatic system based on neural networks has been designed to identify the emotions expressed by four autistic children throughout the process of interaction with the NAO robot where imitation, play and social interaction activities were developed. The results show that the emotions of sadness and anger are those expressed by the students throughout the activity for the greatest amount of time. Future lines of research include the possibility of designing other types of activities with the robot to analyse the influence they have on the children's moods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Autism; Emotions; NAO; Social robotics","","","","Salari, Nader, The global prevalence of autism spectrum disorder: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, Italian Journal of Pediatrics, 48, 1, (2022); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Premack, David, Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1, 4, pp. 515-526, (1978); Hopkins, Ingrid Maria, Avatar assistant: Improving social skills in students with an asd through a computer-based intervention, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 41, 11, pp. 1543-1555, (2011); Abu-Amara, Fadi, Robot and virtual reality-based intervention in autism: a comprehensive review, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 13, 5, pp. 1879-1891, (2021); Khan, Shahidul Islam, Predicting the level of autism and improvement rate from assessment dataset using machine learning techniques, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 15, 3, pp. 1647-1652, (2023); Al-Nafjan, Abeer N., Measuring Engagement in Robot-Assisted Therapy for Autistic Children, Behavioral Sciences, 13, 8, (2023); Robins, Ben, Tactile Interactions with a Humanoid Robot: Novel Play Scenario Implementations with Children with Autism, International Journal of Social Robotics, 6, 3, pp. 397-415, (2014); Syriopoulou–Delli, Christine K., Review of assistive technology in the training of children with autism spectrum disorders, International Journal of Developmental Disabilities, 68, 2, pp. 73-85, (2022); Cabibihan, John John, Why Robots?

To fulfill the right to education, the government has developed a policy through the implementation of special school. However, despite the existence of SLB, the learning process of students with intellectual disabilities often does not run smoothly because they have difficulty focusing on long-term instructions and are easily distracted by visual distractions. Therefore, assistive technology is needed that is able to attract students' attention during the learning process. Previous research has developed a robot-based interactive learning system for people with intellectual disabilities that is able to improve students' understanding of the material. However, the robot system does not yet have a two-way interaction feature between the robot and students. This research aims to develop the interactive learning system by adding two-way interaction features. The development is done by improving learning materials in the form of verb spelling and student interaction through answer cards. During the learning process with the robot, students showed interest in the robot's motion capabilities and the audiovisual material displayed. Subjects paid close attention to the robot, which led to a significant increase in the average correctness rate of typesetting from 25.55% during conventional learning to 63.86% with the robot. The standard deviation of robot learning was 26.54, while conventional was 18.47, indicating higher consistency with the robot. Factors such as subjects' memory performance and learning environment conditions may affect the inconsistency of the results. Robotic learning proved to be effective for subjects A and C, and moderately effective for subject B. Future research development plans include real-time data collection and processing with IoT as well as increasing the level of materials such as counting and social skills of money use. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audiovisual Intervention; Fuzzy Logic; Intellectual Disabilities; Robotics; Special Needs Education","Adversarial machine learning; Data acquisition; Disabled persons; Educational robots; Learning aids for disabled persons; Machine learning; Robot learning; Assistive system; Audiovisual intervention; Fuzzy-Logic; Intellectual disability; Interaction features; Interactive learning; Interactive learning systems; Learning process; Special needs educations; Two-way interaction; Students","","","Patel, Dilip R., Intellectual disability: Definitions, evaluation and principles of treatment, Pediatric Medicine, 1, (2018); Statistik Sekolah Luar Biasa 2020 2021, (2021); Jacob, Udeme Samuel, Attention Span of Children With Mild Intellectual Disability: Does Music Therapy and Pictorial Illustration Play Any Significant Role?, Frontiers in Psychology, 12, (2021); Journal of Clinical Medicine Research, (2023); So, Wing Chee, Who is a better teacher for children with autism?

A lack of support for special education; tensions between teachers, students, and parents; and limited backup for teacher absences are common complaints among Korean educators. New innovations in technology to screen and treat ADHD and ASD may offer relief to students, parents, and teachers through earlier and efficient diagnosis; access to treatment options; and ultimately, better-managed care and expectations. Objective: This narrative literature review provides an account of medical device use and development in South Korea for the diagnosis and management of ADHD and ASD and highlights research gaps. Methods: A narrative review was conducted across 4 databases (PubMed, Korean National Assembly Library, Scopus, and PsycINFO). Journal articles, dissertations, and government research and development reports were included if they discussed medical devices for ADHD and ASD. Only Korean or English papers were included. Resources were excluded if they did not correspond to the research objective or did not discuss at least 1 topic about medical devices for ADHD and ASD. Journal articles were excluded if they were not peer reviewed. Resources were limited to publications between 2013 and July 22, 2024. Results: A total of 1794 records about trends in Korean medical device development were categorized into 2 major groups: digital therapeutics and traditional therapy. Digital therapeutics resulted in 5 subgroups: virtual reality and artificial intelligence, machine learning and robot, gaming and visual contents, eye-feedback and movement intervention, and electroencephalography and neurofeedback. Traditional therapy resulted in 3 subgroups: cognitive behavioral therapy and working memory; diagnosis and rating scale; and musical, literary therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Digital therapeutics using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and electroencephalography technologies account for the biggest portions of development in South Korea, rather than traditional therapies. Most resources, 94.15% (1689/1794), were from the Korean National Assembly Library. Conclusions: Limitations include small sizes of populations to conclude findings in many articles, a lower number of articles discussing medical devices for ASD, and a majority of articles being dissertations. Emerging digital medical devices and those integrated with traditional therapies are important solutions to reducing the prevalence rates of ADHD and ASD in South Korea by promoting early diagnosis and intervention. Furthermore, their application will relieve pressures on teachers and school-based special education programming by providing direct supporting resources to students with ADHD or ASD. Future development of medical devices for ADHD and ASD is predicted to heavily rely on digital technologies, such as those that sense people’s behaviors, eye movement, and brainwaves. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ADHD; ASD; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; autism spectrum disorder; digital therapeutics; medical device","","","","Res Emot Behav Disord, (2014); undefined; Whisper the News; I can T Even Get Sick School Special Education with Only One Teacher in Mind; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Diagnosis and Management of Adhd in Children Young People and Adults, (2008); Autism Spectrum Disorder; Hira Bigdata Open Portal, (2023); Number of Patients with Activity and Attention Disorder F900; Announcement of the Results of the 2021 Survey on the Status of Persons with Developmental Disabilities; Main Indicators of the 2021 Survey on the Status of People with Developmental Disabilities, (2022)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","25613278","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219613642"

This is especially true considering the latest advancements of wearable and sensing technologies, which are accompanying us in every-day life, and are exploited in different applications spanning from continuous patient monitoring to immersive video-game experiences. While these novel applications can positively impact a user’s life, work, education, health, and free-time, their development should be rigorous and consider a possible real-time configuration, the quality and quantity of available data, the portability of the employed technologies, the scalability of AI strategies, and the ethical and regulatory aspects concerning the use of personal data, just to name a few challenges. The AIxHMI workshop aims to connect researchers and practitioners from different fields to collect multidisciplinary contributions on topics concerning HMI and especially on the influence that AI has in the interaction between humans and machines. Thirteen papers have been submitted to the third edition of AIxHMI. Out of these, two have been accepted for oral presentation as abstracts, five as short papers, and five as regular papers. The authors and three invited speakers have presented very diverse topics and approaches bounded to the HMI field, from the use of large language models to the assessment of agreement and reliance in learning tasks, from biomarkers and multimedia signals to robots used in treating autism spectrum condition, from generative art to the use of augmented reality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Diseases; Medical education; Wearable technology; Education healths; Game experience; Human machine interaction; Human machine interaction system; Immersive; Novel applications; Real- time; Reliability efficiencies; Sensing technology; Video-games; Augmented reality","","","Crocamo, Cristina, Digital biomarkers of mood states from speech in bipolar disorder, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3903, pp. 1-7, (2024); Grossi, Alessandra, Are we all good actors?

This study aimed to develop ML algorithms to predict the upper tertile group of various anxiety symptoms based on multimodal data from virtual reality (VR) therapy sessions for social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients and to evaluate their predictive performance across each data type. Methods: This study included 32 SAD-diagnosed individuals, and finalized a dataset of 132 samples from 25 participants. It utilized multimodal (physiological and acoustic) data from VR sessions to simulate social anxiety scenarios. This study employed extended Geneva minimalistic acoustic parameter set for acoustic feature extraction and extracted statistical attributes from time series-based physiological responses. We developed ML models that predict the upper tertile group for various anxiety symptoms in SAD using Random Forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) models. The best parameters were explored through grid search or random search, and the models were validated using stratified cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: The CatBoost, using multimodal features, exhibited high performance, particularly for the Social Phobia Scale with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.852. It also showed strong performance in predicting cognitive symptoms, with the highest AUROC of 0.866 for the Post-Event Rumination Scale. For generalized anxiety, the LightGBM’s prediction for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-trait led to an AUROC of 0.819. In the same analysis, models using only physiological features had AUROCs of 0.626, 0.744, and 0.671, whereas models using only acoustic features had AUROCs of 0.788, 0.823, and 0.754. Conclusions: This study showed that a ML algorithm using integrated multimodal data can predict upper tertile anxiety symptoms in patients with SAD with higher performance than acoustic or physiological data obtained during a VR session. The results of this study can be used as evidence for personalized VR sessions and to demonstrate the strength of the clinical use of multimodal data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anxiety prediction; digital phenotyping; digital psychiatry; machine learning; multimodal data; social anxiety disorder; virtual reality intervention","adult; algorithm; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Article; autism; Beck Anxiety Inventory; bipolar disorder; controlled study; electrodermal response; female; Glasgow coma scale; heart rate; human; human experiment; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; machine learning; major depression; male; mental disease; mental health; observational study; phenotype; phobia; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; robot-assisted prostatectomy; schizophrenia; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; simulation; social interaction; social phobia; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; training; virtual reality; white matter; young adult","","","Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Kessler, Ronald C., Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the national comorbidity survey replication, Archives of General Psychiatry, 62, 6, pp. 593-602, (2005); Hofmann, Stefan G., Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult anxiety disorders: A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 69, 4, pp. 621-632, (2008); Vaswani, Meera, Role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in psychiatric disorders: A comprehensive review, Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 27, 1, pp. 85-102, (2003); Cieślik, Błażej, Virtual reality in psychiatric disorders: A systematic review of reviews, Complementary Therapies in Medicine, 52, (2020); Emmelkamp, P.

Around 58.7 per 10,000 children in Indonesia experience pervasive developmental disorders. Children with pervasive disorders cannot interact well with others. They tend to be attracted to various inanimate objects, due to severe communication limitations and strong obsessive desires. A neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a lack of social interaction, social interaction (verbal and nonverbal), and repetitive behavior or restricted interests is commonly called pervasive autism. developmental disorder (APDD). Many researchers and doctors have developed autism treatments by teaching children with APPD several approaches or methods to develop their social and mental skills, including the use of technology. Aurel's study (Autism Robotics Experience for Learners) is based on deep-based artificial intelligence applications learning so that the robot can be directly controlled for movement and audio-visual systems. Aurel was developed to provide interventions for children on the autism spectrum (APDD). Aurel's is designed to create movements and sounds that help children with APPD develop social skills. Aurel matches the characteristics of autistic children (APDD), has eyesight, and likes technology. In doing so, Aurel uses an early intervention method or approach. Early intervention is therapy for children from birth to 3 years of age for children with special needs and growth and development disorders. Aurel can carry out activities to observe the development of early childhood children to optimize skills according to their needs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aurel's (Autism Robotics Experience for Learner's); Autism; Experience; Learner's; Robotics","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Federated learning; Medical robotics; Robot learning; Robots; Artificial intelligence learning; Autism; Autism robotic experience for learner; Development disorders; Early intervention; Experience; Learner; Pervasive developmental disorders; Psychomotors; Social interactions; Diseases","","","A Systematic Reviews of Literature Life Science Journal, (2013); Let S Recognize and Care for Children Withautism, (2011); Dorland S Medical Dictionary, (2025); Perspectives of Children with Disabilities in an Introduction to Psychopedagogy for Children with Disabilities, (2009); Amraee, Somaieh, Analytical study of two feature extraction methods in comparison with deep learning methods for classification of small metal objects, Visual Computing for Industry, Biomedicine, and Art, 5, 1, (2022); Depression in Management Stress Worry Depression, (2011); Disruption Pervasive in Synopsis Psychiatry, (2010); Guidelines Handling Child Necessary Special, (2010); Delhi Psychiatry Journal, (2012); Mothers Experiences in Caring for Children with Special Needs Autism in Banjar Baru South Kalimantan, (2011)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Consumer Technology Society Indonesia Chapter (CTSoc)","1st IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Technology, ISCT 2024","","Hybrid, Bali","205290","21591423; 0747668X","9781479938308; 9780780394599; 9781457702310; 142440763X; 9781424425594; 9781424407637; 9781424414581; 142441458X; 9781728151861; 9781665441544","DTPEE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215279243"

However, a critical challenge is that modern AI techniques like deep learning (DL) typically require large datasets with millions of samples, yet in healthcare we are often working with smaller clinical samples (<50 participants). To address that challenge, we need to develop new approaches that can learn more efficiently from less data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to few-shot learning (FSL) called SMOTE_FSL, which is applicable to traditional machine learning (ML) models, allowing them to work with smaller sample sizes as well as various types of healthcare data (not only image or text data). We compare SMOTE_FSL on two healthcare sensor datasets gathered using robots and wearables, with results showing SMOTE_FSL performs comparably to state-of-the-art DL-based FSL methods (e.g. autoencoders, generative adversarial networks [GAN]). That indicates such an approach holds potential to expand utilization of FSL to a broad range of healthcare data derived from smaller clinical sample sizes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Deep Learning; Few Shot Learning; Machine Learning; Sensor Data; SMOTE","Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Diseases; Electronic health record; Generative adversarial networks; Zero-shot learning; Artificial intelligence techniques; Autism; Clinical samples; Few shot learning; Learning approach; Learning classifiers; Machine-learning; Sensors data; SMOTE; Adversarial machine learning","","","Lombardo, Michael V., Big data approaches to decomposing heterogeneity across the autism spectrum, Molecular Psychiatry, 24, 10, pp. 1435-1450, (2019); Perspect Clin Res, (2016); Lombardo, Michael V., Prototyping as subtyping strategy for studying heterogeneity in autism, Autism Research, 14, 10, pp. 2224-2227, (2021); Healy, Sean, The effect of physical activity interventions on youth with autism spectrum disorder: A meta-analysis, Autism Research, 11, 6, pp. 818-833, (2018); Song, Yisheng, A Comprehensive Survey of Few-shot Learning: Evolution, Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 13s, (2023); Wang, Yaqing, Generalizing from a Few Examples: A Survey on Few-shot Learning, ACM Computing Surveys, 53, 3, (2021); Shickel, Benjamin, Deep EHR: A Survey of Recent Advances in Deep Learning Techniques for Electronic Health Record (EHR) Analysis, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 22, 5, pp. 1589-1604, (2018); Si, Yuqi, Deep representation learning of patient data from Electronic Health Records (EHR): A systematic review, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 115, (2021); Bennett, Casey C., Enabling Robotic Pets to Autonomously Adapt Their Own Behaviors to Enhance Therapeutic Effects: A Data-Driven Approach∗, IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication, RO-MAN, pp. 1625-1632, (2023); Bennett, Casey C., Comparison of In-home Robotic Companion Pet Use in South Korea and the United States: A Case Study, Proceedings of the IEEE RAS and EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics, 2022-August, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE; IEEE EMBS; National Science Foundation�s (NSF); Northwestern University Department of Preventive Medicine; Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering","20th IEEE International Conference on Body Sensor Networks, BSN 2024","","Chicago; IL; DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile","205035","","9798331530143","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215110447"

The current study designed a robot-assisted training with controlled social interactions aiming to enhance the prosody of children with Autism speaking a tonal language, Cantonese, specifically on focus marking. 20 autistic and 23 typically-developing (TD) children participated in this study. Only the autistic group received training. Stimuli were designed for training, pre- and post-training production. Acoustics of target words were extracted and analysed using linear mixed-effects models examining effects of training and clinical status. Children with Autism improved in signalling sentence prominence using duration but not f0 and intensity. Variability suggests that certain acoustic cues are more challenging. Comparing to TD children's focus marking patterns, autistic children's variability may also stem from their ongoing prosodic profile development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorder; robot-assisted training; speech prosody","Robots; Speech enhancement; 'current; Autism spectrum disorders; Cantonese; Children with autisms; Pre-training; Robot-assisted training; Social interactions; Speech prosody; Speech training; Tonal languages; Diseases","","","Xu, Yi, Phonetic realization of focus in English declarative intonation, Journal of Phonetics, 33, 2, pp. 159-197, (2005); Intonation, (1997); Breen, Mara, Acoustic correlates of information structure, Language and Cognitive Processes, 25, 7, pp. 1044-1098, (2010); Papers in Laboratory Phonology V Acquisition and the Lexicon, (2000); Lieberman, Philip H., Some Acoustic Correlates of Word Stress in American English, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 32, 4, pp. 451-454, (1960); Mücke, Doris, The effect of focus marking on supralaryngeal articulation - Is it mediated by accentuation?, Journal of Phonetics, 44, 1, pp. 47-61, (2014); Front Artif Intell; Asghari, Seyedeh Zahra, Distinctive prosodic features of people with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis study, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Lord, Catherine E., Autism spectrum disorder, The Lancet, 392, 10146, pp. 508-520, (2018); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000)","","International Speech Communication Association","Amazon Science; Apple; AppTek; et al.; Google; Meta","25th Interspeech Conferece 2024","","Kos Island","204983","29581796; 2308457X","9781713836902; 9781713820697; 9781605603162; 9781617821233; 9781604234497","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214799466"

The worsening of symptoms and the emergence of challenging behaviors can be a barrier to learning, which is provided by interpersonal relationships. The question may be raised as to the impact of the reduction of the infinite number of unpredictable social outputs between persons on the condition of people with autism. Technological devices and robots can create an environment that can develop the individual’s abilities in a personalized way, limiting distracting stimuli in the environment but maintaining interest. The use of technology can be a good complementary tool to therapy and teaching, but it requires careful pedagogical work to structure learning situations appropriately. Based on current knowledge, there are positive examples of reducing the symptoms of the condition, but more in-depth research on the topic is warranted to evaluate interventions over time, with a wider range of target populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism spectrum disorders; impact; robots; skills; symptoms; use","","","","Am Psychiatr Assoc Publ, (2022); Francis, Konstantinos, Prevention in Autism spectrum disorder: A lifelong focused approach, Brain Sciences, 11, 2, pp. 1-19, (2021); A Gyermek Es Ifjukor Psziches Zavarainak Tankonyve, (2015); Posar, Annio, Long-term outcome of autism spectrum disorder, Turk Pediatri Arsivi, 54, 4, pp. 207-212, (2019); Autism, (2023); Maenner, Matthew J., Prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among children aged 8 Years-Autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 11 Sites, United States, 2016, MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 69, 4, pp. 1-12, (2020); Alghamdi, Maha Mesfer Meshref, Assessing the Potential of Robotics Technology for Enhancing Educational for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavioral Sciences, 13, 7, (2023); Clabaugh, Caitlyn E., Escaping Oz: Autonomy in Socially Assistive Robotics, Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems, 2, pp. 33-61, (2019); Begum, Momotaz, Are Robots Ready to Deliver Autism Interventions?

Some children with developmental disorders struggle with sentence writing skill. Although previous research has discovered the effectiveness of a robot intervention in social skill training for children with developmental disorders, few studies have conducted writing skill training for them and demonstrated its effectiveness. In this study, we aim to investigate four types of writing skill enhancement systems through dialogue with presence/absence of a companion robot and input methods (speech recognition/typing) for the effectiveness of improving the writing skills of children with developmental disorders. The dialogue system uses Chat-GPT, ChatAPIs, to generate responses. This paper investigated the four developed writing skill enhancement systems targeted at university students as a preliminary experiment for testing with children with developmental disorders. Experimental results showed a tendency to elicit a large number of words from the students through the interaction with the system using speech recognition and a companion robot. In addition, there was no consistent trend between the survey results and the system that was found to be most suitable, indicating the possibility of not being able to select an effective system based only on survey results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","developmental disor-der; robot interaction; speech recognition; typing; writing skill enhancement","Microrobots; Nanorobots; Robot learning; Speech enhancement; Speech recognition; Companion robot; Developmental disor-der; Developmental disorders; Input methods; Robot interactions; Skill training; Social skills training; Typing; Writing skill enhancement; Writing skills; Students","","","Scassellati, Brian, Robots for use in autism research, Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering, 14, pp. 275-294, (2012); Frontiers in Robotics and AI, (2021); Bakola, Lizeta N., ICTs for emotional and social skills development for children with ADHD and ASD Co-existence, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, 14, 5, pp. 122-131, (2019); Japanese Journal of Behavior Analysis, (2009); 12th International Symposium of Robotics Research, (2005); Dautenhahn, Kerstin, Towards interactive robots in autism therapy: Background, motivation and challenges, Pragmatics and Cognition, 12, 1, pp. 1-35, (2004); Ghiglino, Davide, Follow the white robot: Efficacy of robot-assistive training for children with autism spectrum disorder, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 86, (2021); Journal of the Robotics Society of Japan, (2009); Development of A Humanoid Robot Based Communication System for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder, (2022); Spitale, Micol, Using Socially Assistive Robots in Speech-Language Therapy for Children with Language Impairments, International Journal of Social Robotics, 15, 9-10, pp. 1525-1542, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","Joint 13th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 25th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems, SCIS and ISIS 2024","","Himeji","204675","","9798350373332","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214704712"

Therefore, this study develops a child-like robot that can train clinical psychologists in intelligence testing (hereinafter referred to as the 'proposed robot'). The proposed robot is equipped with the same speech content as that of a child undergoing intelligence testing. The clinical psychologist trains the robot to perform the intelligence test by talking to the robot.

However, the correct use of digital technologies such as personalization settings and interaction with robots has clearly shown how these new technologies can benefit ASD students. However, it is essential to characterize the profile, problems, and needs of each student, since it is not possible to generalize an accessible approach for all users. The work presented shows the creation and validation, through pilot tests, of an instrument that outlines the main needs of a student with ASD, based on behavioral variables. In a later phase, instructional sequences will be designed and adapted through digital tablets and interaction with a robot to improve specific aspects identified in the initial profile. The results demonstrate the method’s ability to assess and prioritize profiles satisfactorily which helps create a design adjusted to each student. The first pilot tests have been well received by ASD students, who have shown increased interest in the contents and methods used in this approach. Motivation levels and engagement have also increased, and social interactions with their peers have improved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorder; diversity; educational innovation; educational robotics; inclusion; social robotics","Article; autism; child; cognition; data analysis; digital technology; education; health disparity; health practitioner; human; human experiment; language; machine learning; pilot study; psychologist; robotics; school child; social competence; social inclusion; social interaction; stereotypy","","","Salari, Nader, The global prevalence of autism spectrum disorder: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, Italian Journal of Pediatrics, 48, 1, (2022); Wozniak, Robert H., The development of autism spectrum disorders: variability and causal complexity, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science, 8, 1-2, (2017); Kamp-Becker, Inge, Autism spectrum disorder in ICD-11—a critical reflection of its possible impact on clinical practice and research, Molecular Psychiatry, 29, 3, pp. 633-638, (2024); Sridhar, Aksheya, Patterns of intervention utilization among school-aged children on the autism spectrum: Findings from a multi-site research consortium, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 94, (2022); Ozonoff, Sally J., Evidence-based assessment of autism spectrum disorders in children and adolescents, Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 34, 3, pp. 523-540, (2005); Odom, Samuel L., Educational Interventions for Children and Youth with Autism: A 40-Year Perspective, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 51, 12, pp. 4354-4369, (2021); Vivanti, Giacomo, Predictors of outcomes in autism early intervention: Why don't we know more?, Frontiers in Pediatrics, 2, JUN, (2014); McLeod, Justin W.H., Variables Associated With Successful Treatment Outcomes of Autistic Youth Enrolled in PEERS, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 13, (2022); Kim, So Hyun, Variability in Autism Symptom Trajectories Using Repeated Observations From 14 to 36 Months of Age, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 57, 11, pp. 837-848.e2, (2018); Ozonoff, Sally J., Onset patterns in autism: Variation across informants, methods, and timing, Autism Research, 11, 5, pp. 788-797, (2018)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","16640640","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210488394"

Technology, particularly robots, holds promise for helping children with autism understand and communicate their emotions. However, there is limited research on emotional identification in children with autism during interactions with robots. This study aims to fill that gap by identifying emotional responses and proposing a emotion classification for children with autism during robot movement interactions. Observation and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data, using seven specific robot movements. Then, KJ Method was utilized to develop the classification. The result includes emotional response keywords and its classification for emotional responses in children with autism during robot movement interactions. While these findings are preliminary, the reference classification provides valuable insights into interpreting emotional responses in children with autism and can serve as a helpful guide for integrating robots into their daily activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism; Emotion classification; Kansei; KJ Method; Robot Movement","Adversarial machine learning; Microrobots; Autism; Case-studies; Children with autisms; Emotion classification; Emotional response; Kansei; KJ method; Malaysia; Robot movements; Semi structured interviews; Emotion Recognition","","","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Autism Spectrum Disorder Asd, (2022); Maw, Su Su, Effectiveness of cognitive, developmental, and behavioural interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder in preschool-aged children: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Heliyon, 4, 9, (2018); Saleh, Mohammed Ahmed, Robots and autistic children: A review, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences, 8, 3, pp. 1247-1262, (2020); Bartl-Pokorny, Katrin D., Robot-Based Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Literature Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 165433-165450, (2021); Valadão, Carlõs Torturella, Analysis of the use of a robot to improve social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder, Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica, 32, 2, pp. 161-175, (2016); Lokman, A.

It is an invalidating behavioral symptom that is frequently present across different psychiatric conditions and neurocognitive disorders including Korsakoff’s Syndrome (KS). In fact, apathy is one of the most severe behavioral symptoms of KS and has a major impact on the lives of patients and their relatives and other informal caregivers. However, guidelines for the treatment of apathy in KS are currently not available. This systematic narrative review provides a transdiagnostic overview of the effectiveness of different types of non-pharmacological interventions on apathy across different study populations that at symptom-level share characteristics with KS. This evidence may inform the development of an intervention targeting apathy in KS. The included study populations are dementia (due to Alzheimer’s disease, or vascular dementia), Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Through a stepped selection approach and with regard to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 22 systematic reviews and 32 empirical articles on the non-pharmacological treatment of apathy were identified. The results show a variety of effective non-pharmacological interventions on apathy. In conditions with severe cognitive impairments, successful interventions did not rely on intrinsic motivation, self-monitoring, or illness insight of the patients, but depend on external stimulation and behavioral activation. Since apathy is a multidimensional construct, identification of the extent and type of apathetic behavior before starting an intervention is highly recommended. Furthermore, it is important to adjust the treatment to the patients’ personal interests and needs and embedded in daily care.

The use of SNs in Robot-Assisted Play (RAP) can offer creative ways to address social and communication challenges of children with functional needs. In this study, we evaluate the initial use of social stories in robot-assisted therapy to help 17 children with diverse conditions such as Down Syndrome (DS), Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC), and speech disorders (SD) understand and act on real-world situations while interacting with the social robot Furhat. We developed educational stories based on six common professions to show how each professional works and interacts with people. We conducted a user study as part of their daily intervention in a rehabilitation center over two weeks. Overall results demonstrate that there were no significant differences in socio-emotional outcomes among children grouped by their diagnosis, age, and other characteristics. However, their communication skills played a significant role in their performance; in particular, children with verbal abilities had higher completion time in activities compared to their non-verbal counterparts. This result was supported by two therapists who reported higher engagement with the robot among verbal children. We suggest that the SN-inspired intervention could be used to support children with diverse special needs, without causing any negative impacts on their learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Diseases; Social robots; Condition; Creatives; Down's syndrome; Functionals; Pilot studies; Real world situations; Robot-assisted therapies; Spectra's; Speech disorders; Microrobots","","","Robins, Ben, Human-centred design methods: Developing scenarios for robot assisted play informed by user panels and field trials, International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 68, 12, pp. 873-898, (2010); Shukla, Jainendra, Robot Assisted Interventions for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities: Impact on Users and Caregivers, International Journal of Social Robotics, 11, 4, pp. 631-649, (2019); International Journal of Social Robotics, (2022); Baron-Cohen, Simon B., Autism: A window onto the development of the social and the analytic brain, Annual Review of Neuroscience, 28, pp. 109-126, (2005); Scattone, Dorothy, Increasing Appropriate Social Interactions of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders Using Social Stories™, Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 21, 4, pp. 211-222, (2006); Hume, Kara A., Evidence-Based Practices for Children, Youth, and Young Adults with Autism: Third Generation Review, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 51, 11, pp. 4013-4032, (2021); Leaf, Justin Barrett, A Critical Review of Social Narratives, Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities, 32, 2, pp. 241-256, (2020); Sansosti, Frank J., A Research Synthesis of Social Story Interventions for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 19, 4, pp. 194-204, (2004); Reynhout, Georgina, Social Story™ Efficacy With a Child With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Moderate Intellectual Disability, Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 22, 3, pp. 173-181, (2007); A Pilot Study to Determine the Efficacy of A Social Storytm Intervention for A Child with Autistic Disorder Intellectual Disability and Limited Language Skills, (2008)","","IEEE Computer Society","","33rd IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, ROMAN 2024","","Pasadena; CA; Pasadena Convention Center","203776","19449445; 19449437","9798350375022; 9798350336702","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209780965"

Socially-assistive robots (SARs) have been found effective in engaging and interacting with autistic children, however, the perception intelligence during interaction still needs more domain-specific knowledge in terms of understanding children's behaviors. The Family Observation Schedule-Second Version (FOS-II) is one of the key methods in assessing parent-child interactions in developmental disabilities, yet its manual annotation demands considerable time and effort. This study proposes a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model using video and audio inputs for automated FOS-II annotation. Utilizing advanced deep learning for behavior recognition, this method offers rapid, cost-effective FOS-II scaling. It will thus enhance the capability of socially assistive robots to understand human behaviors and support the advancement of digital health research for children with autism. The visual perception in home settings are most likely based on uncontrolled environments, so it is crucial to develop algorithms that can robustly work with video-log data with uncontrolled quality. Ultimately, it aims to ease the burden on parents and caregivers, streamlining the monitoring and treatment of challenging behaviors in autism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deep neural networks; Electronic health record; mHealth; Robots; Autistic children; Children with autisms; Developmental disability; Domain-specific knowledge; Interactive behavior; Manual annotation; Multi-modal; Neural-networks; Parent-child interactions; Socially assistive robots; Diseases","","","Chiarotti, Flavia, Epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders: A review of worldwide prevalence estimates since 2014, Brain Sciences, 10, 5, (2020); Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2010); Hertz-Picciotto, Irva, The rise in autism and the role of age at diagnosis, Epidemiology, 20, 1, pp. 84-90, (2009); Maenner, Matthew J., Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2020, MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 72, 2, (2023); Mayes, Susan Dickerson, Symptoms of Autism in Young Children and Correspondence with the DSM, Infants and Young Children, 12, 2, pp. 90-97, (1999); Sanders, Matthew R., TRAINING PARENTS IN BEHAVIORAL SELF‐MANAGEMENT: AN ANALYSIS OF GENERALIZATION AND MAINTENANCE, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 14, 3, pp. 223-237, (1981); Journal of Rehabilitation Psychology, (2016); Xie, Baijun, Can You Guess My Moves?""

Numerous robotic intervention systems have been proposed for children with autism. It is widely acknowledged that engagement with the robotic system is important for intervention success. Visual attention toward the robot can be used as a proxy for engagement. However, less is known about how to maintain and enhance visual attention within a robotic system, and how the variation of visual attention may influence adaptation of dynamic intervention protocols to improve outcomes. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new metric, System Capture Ratio (SCR), that can be automatically quantified in real-time, to measure a participant's visual attention within a robotic system designed for joint attention intervention for children with autism. Then, we demonstrate that compared to a static intervention protocol, a dynamic intervention protocol can help sustain visual attention and thus achieve a significant performance improvement. The results support the implementation of adaptive and dynamic robotic intervention protocols for autistic children that are based on SCR, offering suggestions on designing effective multi-session studies for autism intervention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Medical robotics; Microrobots; Robot learning; Autistic children; Capture ratio; Children with autisms; Joint attention; Performance; Protocol cans; Real- time; Robotic systems; Visual Attention; Young children; Multipurpose robots","","","Maenner, Matthew J., Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2020, MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 72, 2, (2023); Lord, Catherine E., Autism spectrum disorders, pp. 217-225, (2013); Gillespie-Lynch, Kristen, Early childhood predictors of the social competence of adults with autism, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 42, 2, pp. 161-174, (2012); Schertz, Hannah H., Effects of Joint Attention Mediated Learning for toddlers with autism spectrum disorders: An initial randomized controlled study, Early Childhood Research Quarterly, 28, 2, pp. 249-258, (2013); Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2011); Scassellati, Brian, Robots for use in autism research, Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering, 14, pp. 275-294, (2012); Feil-Seifer, David J., Socially assistive robotics: Ethical issues related to technology, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 18, 1, pp. 24-31, (2011); Zheng, Zhi, Autonomous robot-mediated imitation learning for children with autism, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2707-2712, (2014); Billard, Aude G., Building robota, a mini-humanoid robot for the rehabilitation of children with autism, Assistive Technology, 19, 1, pp. 37-49, (2007); Proc 27th IEEE Int Symp Robot Hum Interact Commun Ro Man, (2018)","","IEEE Computer Society","","33rd IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, ROMAN 2024","","Pasadena; CA; Pasadena Convention Center","203776","19449445; 19449437","9798350375022; 9798350336702","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209779338"

Four 17-year-old participants were recruited from a special needs school. We observed their engagement in assigned tasks and any significant interactions with the robot during the three personalized learning sessions in the school environment. During sessions without a robot, each student was asked to solve arithmetic questions related to purchasing items. During sessions with a robot, each student was required to not only solve questions but also explain the processes or results of simple calculations to the robot. We examined the behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement of each participant during personalized learning sessions. The results showed that participants solved problems faster, more accurately, or with fewer distractions in the with-robot conditions compared to the task-only conditions. It suggests that this approach, where students explain what they know to a robot, might be effectively adopted for students in special needs schools. Future research should examine the role of robots more comprehensively, acknowledging the limitations of this study, such as the measurement of only three sessions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Contrastive Learning; Diseases; Educational robots; Federated learning; Microrobots; Robot learning; Students; Autism spectrum disorders; Condition; Intellectual disability; Learning sessions; Measurements of; Personalized learning; Simple++; Special needs; Table-top; Adversarial machine learning","","","Soori, Mohsen, Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning in advanced robotics, a review, Cognitive Robotics, 3, pp. 54-70, (2023); Current Robotics Reports, (2021); Springer International Publishing, (2020); Roozen, Irene T.M., Are Retail Customers Ready for Service Robot Assistants?, International Journal of Social Robotics, 15, 1, pp. 15-25, (2023); González-González, Carina Soledad, Social robots in hospitals: A systematic review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 13, (2021); Current Robotics Reports, (2020); Belpaeme, Tony, Social robots for education: A review, Science Robotics, 3, 21, (2018); Szafir, Daniel J., Pay attention!

To enable effective feedback provision by the robot, gesture recognition becomes paramount. This paper introduces two approaches for achieving this goal: a multiclass classifier, intended to recognize which gesture is executed, and a set of binary classifiers discerning whether the expected gesture is performed or not. Both models rely on kinematic data acquired through the Azure Kinect camera and a Residual Network as classification model. Moreover, considering the challenges in children's data collection for model training, the work explores the impact that the collection of their data can bring to the outcomes of a gesture classification algorithm. Beside testing on adults and healthy children datasets, the study leverages a dataset comprising 69 gestures performed by ASD children during therapy sessions. Results indicate that binary models trained also on children data outperform the multiclass approach trained solely on adults data, achieving a median accuracy of 86%. This underscores the effectiveness of binary classifiers and suggests that integrating children's data can enhance algorithm performance. To strengthen findings, future research should expand dataset size, especially considering ASD children, and explore alternative action recognition algorithms like Long Short-Term Memories (LSTM). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Diseases; Robots; Autism spectrum disorders; Binary classifiers; Classification models; Data collection; Gestures recognition; Kinect cameras; Kinematic data; Model training; Multi-class classifier; Robot gestures; Gesture recognition","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders Dsm 5, (2013); MMWR Surveill Summ, (2023); Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, (2023); Sandbank, Micheal P., Project AIM: Autism intervention meta-analysis for studies of young children, Psychological Bulletin, 146, 1, pp. 1-29, (2020); De Carolis, Berardina Nadja, Social Robots to Support Gestural Development in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, pp. 376-380, (2021); Beer, Jenay M., Robot assisted music therapy: A case study with children diagnosed with autism, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, 2016-April, pp. 419-420, (2016); Towards Socially Assistive Robotics, (2013); Cao, Hoang Long, Robot-Enhanced Therapy: Development and Validation of Supervised Autonomous Robotic System for Autism Spectrum Disorders Therapy, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 26, 2, pp. 49-58, (2019); DiPietro, Joan, Computer-and robot-assisted therapies to aid social and intellectual functioning of children with autism spectrum disorder, Medicina (Lithuania), 55, 8, (2019); Javed, Hifza, Promoting Social Engagement With a Multi-Role Dancing Robot for In-Home Autism Care, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 9, (2022)","","IEEE Computer Society","","33rd IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, ROMAN 2024","","Pasadena; CA; Pasadena Convention Center","203776","19449445; 19449437","9798350375022; 9798350336702","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209772289"

Socially Assistive Robots, according to recent research, have proven to be capable tools of assisting autistic children to socialize and motivate them to participate in group activities. Socially assistive and educational robots can enhance special education students to practice and learn practical and cognitive skills, like collaboration, and even gain self-confidence. However, each child has different needs, talents, and capabilities, each educator adopts different or tailor-made approaches and each family has its own attitudes and perspectives (Valenti et al., 2020). Methodology is the key factor to bridge the human factor with each robots’ capabilities in order to support the children. Thus, we are going to focus on methodological approaches and also how to design a program/intervention based on each case. In the current chapter, we will highlight the robots’ characteristics that promote social inclusion, enhance learning in autistic children, while at the same time helping special educators and parents to communicate with them. Additionally, we will focus on the use of the Daisy robot, a fluffy, interactive flower-like robot and the ARRoW, a method designed to enhance communication skills in autistic children is the ARRoW method, comprising five distinct steps. Grounded in two inclusion strategies, PS and PMI, this approach seeks to improve and generalize communication and collaboration skills. Utilizing technology, the ARRoW method is tailored to each child's needs, considering factors such as age, characteristics, weaknesses, and interests. This customization promotes the attainment of educational, emotional, and behavioral objectives, making it a comprehensive solution for autistic children. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ARRoW method; Cognitive skills; Daisy robot; Socialization; Socially Assistive Robots (SAR)","","","","Aly, Amir, Towards an intelligent system for generating an adapted verbal and nonverbal combined behavior in human–robot interaction, Autonomous Robots, 40, 2, pp. 193-209, (2016); Bartneck, Christoph, Human-Robot Interaction: An Introduction, pp. 1-251, (2020); Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought, (2008); Dziergwa, Michał, Long-Term Cohabitation with a Social Robot: A Case Study of the Influence of Human Attachment Patterns, International Journal of Social Robotics, 10, 1, pp. 163-176, (2018); Feil-Seifer, David J., Defining socially assistive robotics, 2005, pp. 465-468, (2005); Fischer, Aaron J., Increasing student compliance with teacher instructions using telepresence robot problem-solving teleconsultation, International Journal of School and Educational Psychology, 7, sup1, pp. 158-172, (2019); Fong, Terrence W., A survey of socially interactive robots, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 42, 3-4, pp. 143-166, (2003); Koegel, Lynn Kern, Interventions for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders in Inclusive School Settings, Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, 19, 3, pp. 401-412, (2012); Marmpena, Mina, How does the robot feel?

Dacunha (France), R. Vallée (France), T. Ogawa (Japan), M. Choi (South Korea), L. Blavette (France). ISSUE The rapid development and deployment of robotic applications in gerontechnology, such as socially assistive robots for companionship and daily assistance, virtual coaches, and virtual agents for health monitoring or cognitive support, have the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for older adults (Góngora Alonso et al., 2019). However, this advancement brings forth a multitude of ethical challenges that need to be addressed from various stakeholder perspectives. Primary users, such as older adults, along with informal and formal caregivers, regulators, and healthcare providers, are directly impacted by these technologies. Ethical concerns also extend to companies developing socially assistive robots and the programmers designing the systems for robot behavior control and data handling (Sharkey & Sharkey, 2012; Van Wynsberghe, 2016). This symposium aims to explore and address these critical ethical issues, ensuring that the integration of robotic applications in gerontechnology is conducted in a manner that respects the dignity, privacy, and rights of all involved parties. CONTENT Our symposium is designed to bring together speakers from France, Japan, and South Korea. STRUCTURE Dacunha et al. address the ethical challenges of integrating social robots in geriatric care, focusing on developing and assessing an educational module for health professionals. Key issues include obtaining consent, managing risks related to judgment impairment, and preventing excessive attachment to robots among cognitively impaired older adults. Conducted in France, the project involved a literature review, interviews with 20 geriatric care professionals, and the creation of 10 training videos. These videos, evaluated by 44 healthcare professionals, provided ethical and practical recommendations for conducting robot-assisted activities. The positive feedback underscores the importance of addressing ethical concerns and training needs for responsible robot use in geriatric settings. Vallée and Aubergé discuss the impact of humanoid design, perceived usefulness, and expressiveness on the acceptability and trust in human-robot interactions. Using a living lab approach, their studies involving the Miroki robot in hospitals and nursing homes revealed that robots introduced as subjects with high expressiveness were perceived as more flexible and trustworthy. Ogawa discusses the effects of cognitive functions on understanding robot speech, revealing that older adults with cognitive decline struggle to comprehend robot speech compared to human speech. The study highlights the need for specific technical features and alternative communication methods in social robots to aid older adults with dementia, bridging the digital divide and addressing ethical implications in human-robot interaction by ensuring accessibility for vulnerable populations. Choi presents public perceptions of care robots in the context of South Korea's rapidly aging population and shrinking caregiver workforce. Her study, involving an online survey of 1,668 participants, revealed significant variability in knowledge and definitions of care robots, with higher education levels correlating with better understanding. Ethical implications are critical, highlighting the need for public communication and discussions to ensure human-centered and ethically responsible development of care robots. Finally, Blavette et al.’s presentation focuses on participatory design in developing social robots for geriatric care. Engaging 45 residents from four French geriatric institutions, their study assessed their needs and preferences through focus groups and interviews. Key features valued by older adults included video-conferencing, object delivery, and cognitive games, which could enhance their quality of life and social connectedness. The findings underscore the importance of involving end-users in the design process to ensure ethical and practical success in technological innovations for geriatric care. CONCLUSION This symposium will explore the participatory design of social robots for geriatric care, addressing ethical challenges such as consent, attachment, and the development of training modules for health professionals. Factors influencing trust in human-robot interactions, the comprehension of robot speech by older adults with cognitive decline, and public perceptions of care robots in rapidly aging societies will also be examined. The critical importance of incorporating ethical reflection in the design, assessment, and deployment of robot-mediated services for older adults will be emphasized, ensuring these technologies are developed and implemented responsibly and respectfully. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cognitive impairment; ethical challenges; geriatric care; human-robot interaction; participatory design; socially assistive robots","","","","Góngora Alonso, Susel, Social Robots for People with Aging and Dementia: A Systematic Review of Literature, Telemedicine and e-Health, 25, 7, pp. 533-540, (2019); Sharkey, Amanda J.C., Granny and the robots: Ethical issues in robot care for the elderly, Ethics and Information Technology, 14, 1, pp. 27-40, (2012); van Wynsberghe, Aimee Robbins, Healthcare robots: Ethics, design and implementation, pp. 1-152, (2016)","","International Society for Gerontechnology","","","","","","15691101; 1569111X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208134743"

For some years now, these robots have been used within the framework of psychosocial interventions for older adults with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Social robots, which resemble humans or animals and are equipped with AI, offer promising solutions but raise ethical and deontological concerns, especially when used with vulnerable elderly populations (Sharkey & Sharkey, 2012; Borenstein & Pearson, 2020; Vandemeulebroucke et al., 2018). A significant challenge is training professionals interested in using social robots with geriatric patients on how to address relevant ethical issues related to consent obtention, impaired judgment, or the risk of attachment. Obtaining fully informed consent may be particularly challenging with persons with cognitive impairment, as it requires ensuring that they fully understand and agree to the use of robots in their care. Judgment-related issues involve assessing whether these individuals, due to potential judgment disorders, truly comprehend the nature of the robot and the purpose of the therapy. Attachment risks concern the potential for older adults with neurocognitive disorders to develop strong emotional bonds and excessive attachment to the robots, which could lead to problematic outcomes. Moreover, professionals may be discouraged or reticent to use this form of intervention because of these ethical issues or other concerns, such as the complexity of integrating new technology into existing care routines. The ROBETHICS project aimed to understand healthcare professionals’ perspectives on IPRS and develop ethical guidelines for their use. Methods and Materials: The project was conducted in France and involved two steps. First, we aimed to understand the ethical challenges faced by professionals working with older adults with neurocognitive impairments when using social robots. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of academic works that studied these issues. Then, we identified the ethical challenges and training needs of professionals in the geriatrics sector by conducting in-depth interviews with 20 professionals working in nursing care institutions. In the second step, the aim was to co-create with healthcare professionals a series of 10 short videos on the introduction of social robots in geriatric settings as part of psychosocial interventions and how to address some of the ethical issues identified in the first phase of the project. Based on recommendations from healthcare professionals, the video scripts were developed by three psychology researchers and shot by a team of professional videographers. The videos covered topics such as defining social robots, preparing psychosocial intervention sessions using social robots, obtaining user consent, and handling various interaction scenarios with the robots. The 10 videos produced were evaluated by 44 healthcare professionals working in six different geriatric facilities. Evaluations included recorded group interviews and a 12-item questionnaire assessing video content, format, and style. Results and Discussion: The professionals addressed two major themes linked to psychosocial interventions using social robots: training needs and ethical issues. They stressed the importance of clarifying the indications and benefits of social robots and addressed ethical issues such as consent and the balance between technology and the human. Indeed, the belief that humans should not be replaced by robots was raised several times. Regarding the videos created, the feedback gathered underlined the effectiveness of the training materials, with positive comments on the clarity, relevance, and modernity of the videos. Feedback indicated good reception and appreciation of the quality of the videos in the geriatric environment. Suggestions for improvement included highlighting key concepts, written fact sheets to accompany the videos, demonstrating the varied functionalities of social robots, as well as dramatizations involving real older adults. Overall, most participants expressed agreement with both the content and the format and style of the videos, suggesting that they are suitable as training aids for healthcare professionals working with older adylts with cognitive impairments.

The effectiveness of a robot to support an older adult therefore refers to the degree of accuracy and completeness with which older adults can accomplish their goals using the robot. The satisfaction of the older adults in this process is vital because it impacts their comfort, willingness to use, actual use, and eventual acceptance of the robot (Boot et al., 2020). Older adults and their care partners have been reported to be open to robots as a care tool (Shishehgar et al., 2019). However, a critical question emerges - are robots ready? Is the task completion process satisfying to the users? These are the questions motivating this research wherein we examined the effectiveness of robots to support older adults and their care partners. Method We examined literature in the past 5 years to identify relevant studies on assistive robots for the care of older adults and to support their care partners. We focused on four stakeholder groups: older adults with mobility impairments, older adults with cognitive impairments, professional caregivers, and family care partners. A total of 44 papers were identified. Robot effectiveness was evaluated using a Likert scale (1-poor to 5-excellent) based on measures reported in the articles related to overall effectiveness such as accuracy and/or completion of the task by the robot. User satisfaction was evaluated using a Likert scale (1-very dissatisfied to 5-very satisfied) based on measures in the articles related to the users’ acceptance of the work completed by the robot and the way it completed the task. We identified emerging themes and gaps that could influence robot effectiveness and user satisfaction. Results and Discussion Our ratings of documented robot effectiveness (M=3.58, SD=0.77) and user satisfaction (M=3.53, SD=0.61) were both in the positive direction above the mid-point of the scale. A one sample t-test revealed that the mean ratings were significantly higher than the mid-point for robot effectiveness (t (18)=3.28, p<0.01) and for user satisfaction (t (18)=3.75, p<0.01). The themes and gaps observed centered around: (i) utility – robot interventions show potential to support older adults with mobility and cognitive impairments with various tasks of daily living; (ii) learning support – adequate training along with instructional support materials are needed to operate these robots; (iii) ease of use and personalization – ease of communication, control, behavior, appearance and ability to be tailored to their personal preferences is critical; and. (iv) error recovery modalities – recurring robot failures were mentioned in several studies without much discussion on recovery options for the users. Overall, our review revealed a positive trend in the effectiveness of the current state of assistive robots to support older adults and their care partners. It also highlighted areas of improvements that could bridge the gap between development and actual use of the robots by the care recipients and care partners to improve their quality of life. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assistive robots; caregivers; seniors; technology acceptance; usability","","","","Designing for Older Adults Case Studies Methods and Tools, (2025); Ergonomics of Human System Interaction Part 11 Usability Definitions and Concepts, (2018); Shishehgar, Majid, The effectiveness of various robotic technologies in assisting older adults, Health Informatics Journal, 25, 3, pp. 892-918, (2019)","","International Society for Gerontechnology","","","","","","15691101; 1569111X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208132950"

The purpose of this study is to improve micro-expression recognition through the optimization of feature transformation and machine learning algorithms. We introduce a novel approach combining Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction, paired with advanced classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, k-NN, Decision Trees) to enhance recognition accuracy of these subtle, rapid facial movements. This combination outperforms previous KPCA and t-SNE approaches in preserving both local and global structures of high-dimensional facial data. Our rigorous experimental design involved 28, 175 samples from the AffectNet dataset (22, 540 for training and 5, 635 for validation), utilizing a combination of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction, followed by random forest classification to capture micro-expressions. Ethical standards, including informed consent and data protection, were strictly maintained throughout. The results show a marked improvement over traditional methods, with our top-performing model achieving 94% accuracy. Key contributions include The optimization of KPCA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, achieving a state-of-the-art 94% accuracy with Random Forest classification on the AffectNet dataset; Significant computational efficiency gains, reducing training time while improving accuracy; Comprehensive quantitative comparisons of classification performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) across various model combinations; and Rigorous analysis of the impact of dimensionality reduction techniques on preserving essential micro-expression features. These advancements significantly push the boundaries of emotion recognition technology. This research has far-reaching implications, potentially revolutionizing lie detection, autism research, and human-robot interaction. Our findings pave the way for a more nuanced understanding of human emotions in various applications.

This study investigates the potential of using a child-height assistive robot named Rudolf to enhance the social reciprocity skills of children with ASD. The research focused on two main questions: how the robot’s semi-autonomous functions influence the enhancement of social reciprocity and how its customizable features elicit and improve these skills. Rudolf was specifically designed to engage children with ASD in a structured, supportive environment, offering tailored interactions to practice social reciprocity. A multiple-probe design was employed over three months to evaluate the robot’s impact on the social skills of three participants with ASD. The study revealed significant improvements in the children’s social reciprocity, with participants demonstrating increased engagement, trust, and interaction within the robot-assisted environment. The customizable functionalities of Rudolf were particularly effective in eliciting and reinforcing interactive behaviors. This research highlights the potential of assistive robots, like Rudolf, in addressing the unique social challenges faced by individuals with ASD. The findings suggest that such robots, when designed with customizable, child-centered features, can significantly enhance social skills in this population.

Developmental disabilities (DDs) include autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), blindness, cerebral palsy, moderate to profound hearing loss, intellectual disability, and other developmental delays (CDC, 2023). Children with DD may experience delays with learning and problems with behavior. Adults may struggle with vocational training, communication, social skills, and basic living skills. Each individual is different, but many people who are neurodivergent struggle with social interaction, repetitive and restricted behaviors, and nonverbal communication. The use of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), is being used in assessment, diagnosis, therapy, learning, accommodations for everyday activities, and in assisting researchers. Early detection is key to improved outcomes, and AI is being investigated as a means for screening and diagnosis. Robotic playmates can aid in both screening and providing therapeutic interventions. Identifying biomarkers is also underway utilizing technological advances such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are providing successful interventions and show promise in many applications due to their realistic experience. AR and VR are currently being utilized to improve social skills and educational outcomes in a variety of settings. Accessibility to technology is becoming more widely available, and positive outcomes are being identified in problem-solving, engagement, communication, job interview skills, tactile tolerance, independence, and activities of daily living. Since many individuals struggle with processing sensory information, the use of VR/AR provides training or diagnosis provides a safe and more predictable environment while allowing for individual preferences. Benefits of AI are currently realized and the potential for future advancement is great. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Abbas, Halim, Multi-modular AI Approach to Streamline Autism Diagnosis in Young Children, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Abdeen, Fahad H., Factors influencing the adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology among parents of individuals with ASD, Interactive Learning Environments, 32, 4, pp. 1330-1347, (2024); Artiran, Saygin, Measuring Social Modulation of Gaze in Autism Spectrum Condition With Virtual Reality Interviews, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 30, pp. 2373-2384, (2022); Bailey, Benjamin, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality for Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Communication Disability and Neurodevelopmental Disorders: a Systematic Review, Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 9, 2, pp. 160-183, (2022); Baus, Oliver, Moving from virtual reality exposure-based therapy to augmented reality exposure-based therapy: A review, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 8, MAR, (2014); Blended Learning Aligning Theory with Practices, (2016); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2023); deLeyer-Tiarks, Johanna M., Advancing autism technology, Psychology in the Schools, 60, 2, pp. 495-506, (2023); Erden, Yasemin J., Automating autism assessment: What AI can bring to the diagnostic process, Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, 27, 3, pp. 485-490, (2021); Gaines, Kristi S., Designing for autism spectrum disorders, pp. 1-220, (2016)","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781032469904; 9781040107775","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206680232"

This pilot study employs a randomized control trial (RCT) design. Additionally, the study explores the efficacy of Reminiscence Therapy (RT) in comparison to Cognitive Training (CT). Eight MCI subjects, with a mean age of 70.125 years, were randomly assigned to 'human-led' or 'SAR-led' groups. Utilizing Functional Near- infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure oxy-hemoglobin concentration changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the study found no significant differences in the effects of human-led and SAR-led cognitive training on DLPFC activation. However, distinct patterns emerged in memory encoding and retrieval phases between RT and CT, suggesting the impacts of these interventions on brain activation in the context of MCI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Brain; Computerized tomography; Infrared spectroscopy; Signal encoding; Social robots; Cognitive impairment; Cognitive training; Cortex activation; Demographic shifts; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Effective therapy; Pilot studies; Prefrontal cortex; Robotic therapies; Socially assistive robots; Near infrared spectroscopy","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Dsm 5, (2013); Smith, Lee, Is loneliness associated with mild cognitive impairment in low- and middle-income countries?, International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 36, 9, pp. 1345-1353, (2021); Desai, Roopal, Living alone and risk of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Ageing Research Reviews, 62, (2020); Mahalingam, Gowsaly, Social connections and risk of incident mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and mortality in 13 longitudinal cohort studies of ageing, Alzheimer's and Dementia, 19, 11, pp. 5114-5128, (2023); Hwang, Jongnam, Effects of participation in social activities on cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults in Korea, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 10, (2018); Chepenik, Lara Gayle, The Influence of Sad Mood on Cognition, Emotion, 7, 4, pp. 802-811, (2007); Li, Huijie, Cognitive intervention for persons with mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis, Ageing Research Reviews, 10, 2, pp. 285-296, (2011); Carrion, C., Cognitive Therapy for Dementia Patients: A Systematic Review, Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders, 46, 1-2, pp. 1-26, (2018); Kasl-Godley, Julia E., Psychosocial interventions for individuals with dementia: An integration of theory, therapy, and a clinical understanding of dementia, Clinical Psychology Review, 20, 6, pp. 755-782, (2000); Chan, Aaron T.C., Computerized cognitive training for memory functions in mild cognitive impairment or dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis, npj Digital Medicine, 7, 1, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","19493045","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204978854"

Equipped with artificial intelligence, sensors, and communication capabilities, these robots possess the capacity to identify emotions, respond to social cues, and adjust their behavior accordingly. The advent of social robots marks a substantial transformation in human-robot interaction, emphasizing emotional connections and social engagement as mechanisms to bridge the gap between humans and machines. In this study, we demonstrate that within the domain of autism therapy, the integration of social robots—QTrobot, NAO, and Pepper—has yielded promising outcomes. Each robot exhibits distinctive features tailored to specific therapeutic requirements. Our conclusions offer guidelines for the selection of the most suitable robot, considering individual strengths and functionalities, within the context of autism therapy. It is important, however, to acknowledge that despite the potential therapeutic applications for individuals with autism, social robots do not constitute a comprehensive solution. Instead, they present supplementary avenues for engagement and learning, acting in tandem with the efforts of human therapists. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ASD; children; Social Robotics","Diseases; Economic and social effects; Industrial robots; Microrobots; Robot applications; Robot learning; ASD; Autism spectrum disorders; Autism therapies; Child; Emotional dimensions; Functional levels; Robot designs; Social robotics; Social robots; Social skills","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Pennisi, Paola, Autism and social robotics: A systematic review, Autism Research, 9, 2, pp. 165-183, (2016); Baron-Cohen, Simon B., The extreme male brain theory of autism, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 6, 6, pp. 248-254, (2002); Baron-Cohen, Simon B., The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism, Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 30, 5, pp. 865-872, (2006); Frolli, Alessandro, Children on the Autism Spectrum and the Use of Virtual Reality for Supporting Social Skills, Children, 9, 2, (2022); Hoffman, Guy, Robotic experience companionship in music listening and video watching, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 20, 1, pp. 51-63, (2016); Erel, Hadas, The Multifaceted Nature of Robotic Companionship when Presented as a Secondary Function, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2021); Romano, Marco, Exploring the Potential of Immersive Virtual Reality in Italian Schools: A Practical Workshop with High School Teachers, Multimodal Technologies and Interaction, 7, 12, (2023); Romano, Marco, Understanding touch and motion gestures for blind people on mobile devices, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9296, pp. 38-46, (2015); Battistoni, Pietro, Sign language interactive learning - measuring the user engagement, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12206 LNCS, pp. 3-12, (2020)","Frolli, A.; Romano, M.; Rega, A.; Bloisi, D.; Aloisio, A.","CEUR-WS","","2024 International Workshop on Digital Innovations for Learning and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, DILeND 2024","","Rome; Universita degli Studi Internazionali di Roma","202211","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203828735"

In order to support people living as long in their preferred environment as possible, human activity recognition plays an important role to develop systems that suit the needs of humans. With the advent of machine learning the techniques used for the activity recognition changed drastically. Often times so called end - to-end learning is applied, which is inherently flawed in terms of flexibility, as the whole model needs to be retrained when parts of the system change, e.g. a change of the used sensor technology. The system proposed in this paper consists of seven sensor nodes which comprise a wireless sensor network. Each node measures the received signal strength and is attached to a kitchen utensil, including one gateway node. Based on this data, a modular machine learning architecture is developed, which is capable of recognising each sub step in the cooking recipe and the recipe as a whole. Experimental studies show promising results and are detailed in this paper. With this information, the system gains the ability to support the user by recognising missing or wrong steps in the cooking process, which can be of direct use for elderly people with mild cognitive impairments in order for them to be able living in their preferred environment as long as possible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cooking; human activity recognition; machine learning; manual labour; object interaction; sup-port; wireless sensor network","Active learning; Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Gateways (computer networks); Human engineering; Machine learning; Modular robots; Human activity recognition; Learning architectures; Machine-learning; Manual labors; Modular machines; Object interactions; Sensors network; Sup-port; Wireless sensor; Sensor nodes","","","World Population Prospects 2022 Summary of Results, (2022); Vrigkas, Michalis, A review of human activity recognition methods, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 2, NOV, (2015); Different Approaches for Human Activity Recognition A Survey, (2019); International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology Ijsrcseit, (2023); Tao, Wenjin, Worker Activity Recognition in Smart Manufacturing Using IMU and sEMG Signals with Convolutional Neural Networks, Procedia Manufacturing, 26, pp. 1159-1166, (2018); Zou, Han, DeepSense: Device-Free Human Activity Recognition via Autoencoder Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network, Conference Record - International Conference on Communications, 2018-May, (2018); Xia, Kun, LSTM-CNN Architecture for Human Activity Recognition, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 56855-56866, (2020); Uci Machine Learning Repository, (2012); Mutegeki, Ronald, A CNN-LSTM Approach to Human Activity Recognition, pp. 362-366, (2020); Uci Machine Learning Repository, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society; Life.Augmented; More Sense S.R.L.; Opto Sensing","19th IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium, SAS 2024","","Naples","202054","","9798350369250","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203713724"

Understanding the characteristics of brain function in MCI patients and intervening early is crucial for dementia prevention and treatment. Utilizing robotic technology for rehabilitation training is an important approach in rehabilitation therapy. We designed a combined cognitive and motor function upper limb rehabilitation training paradigm for MCI patients. The cognitive task (SC) involves numerical cognition, while the motor task (MT) consists of active upper limb training. Motion data during dual-task (DT) periods were collected from patients, and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology was utilized to assess cerebral cortical hemodynamic responses. The aim of this study is to explore the changes in motion data and cerebral cortical hemodynamic responses of MCI patients during rehabilitation training with the Upper Limb Training Device (ULTD), and to evaluate the effectiveness of this paradigm for the rehabilitation training of MCI patients. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the neural processes involved in robot-assisted parallel interactive tasks, providing insights for more effective robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Technology; Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); Rehabilitation Training; Upper Limb Training Device (ULTD)","Arthroplasty; Electrotherapeutics; Functional electric stimulation; Human rehabilitation equipment; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Cognitive functions; Cognitive impairment; Functional near infrared spectroscopy; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy technology; Mild cognitive impairment; Rehabilitation training; Spectroscopy technology; Training devices; Upper limb training device; Upper limbs; Near infrared spectroscopy","","","Wei, Yigang, Predicting population age structures of China, India, and Vietnam by 2030 based on compositional data, PLOS ONE, 14, 4, (2019); Cummings, Jeffrey L., Alzheimer disease, JAMA, 287, 18, pp. 2335-2338, (2002); Malmberg Gavelin, Hanna Malmberg, Combined physical and cognitive training for older adults with and without cognitive impairment: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, Ageing Research Reviews, 66, (2021); Kesaniemi, Yrjö Antero, Dose-response issues concerning physical activity and health: An evidence-based symposium, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 33, 6 SUPPL., pp. S351-S358, (2001); Toosizadeh, Nima, Upper-extremity dual-task function: An innovative method to assess cognitive impairment in older adults, Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, 8, JUN, (2016); Leff, Daniel Richard, Assessment of the cerebral cortex during motor task behaviours in adults: A systematic review of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies, NeuroImage, 54, 4, pp. 2922-2936, (2011); Bae, Sungjin, The optimal speed for cortical activation of passive wrist movements performed by a rehabilitation robot: A functional NIRS study, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 11, (2017); Shi, Ping, Response of the Cerebral Cortex to Resistance and Non-resistance Exercise Under Different Trajectories: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study, Frontiers in Neuroscience, 15, (2021); Wang, Duojin, The identification of interacting brain networks during robot-assisted training with multimodal stimulation, Journal of Neural Engineering, 20, 1, (2023); Nasreddine, Ziad Samir, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA: A brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 53, 4, pp. 695-699, (2005)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","21st IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation, ICMA 2024","","Tianjin","201980","","9798350388060","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203682042"

The work presented in this paper investigates the potential for different machine learning algorithms, applied to data collected through children's wearable sensors while interacting with toys and social robots. Data were collected through the wearable devices and video annotations from the sessions for identification of problematic behaviors. The extracted time features were then integrated with four machine learning algorithms for detection of problematic behavior: the mean, standard deviation, min, and max. The research also takes into consideration the variations in HRV. Among the included machine learning techniques, the XGBoost algorithm has shown a higher rate of better performance and outperformance in detecting problematic behaviors, with 91% accuracy. Physiological features outperform kinetic ones in the detection of problematic behaviors, while the predicting factor of one significant thing is in detecting heart rate accuracy. Difficult behavior in this study is proven to be associated with one particular HRV measure, RMSSD.

In training to administer intelligence tests, practitioners often simulate demonstrations to children or role-play children among adults. However, it is difficult to always secure training subjects is challenging, clinical psychologists are unable to provide sufficient training. Therefore, this study develops a child-like robot (the proposed robot) that is designed to undergo intelligence tests administered by clinical psychologists. The proposed robot is equipped with speech content like that of children undergoing intelligence tests. Clinical psychologists are trained in intelligence testing through conversations with the proposed robot. This paper investigates the impressions of clinical psychologists regarding training with the proposed robot.

Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers.

This can be done using sensing technologies and AI algorithms to process biological signals or facial images to identify the different affective states, such as happiness, anger, fear, surprise, sadness and disgust. This non-invasive technique has applications in healthcare such as emotional impairment detection, mental health assessment, emotional stress assessment, cognitive decline detection, attention deficit disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neurological disorders, autism spectrum disorder, stress, anxiety or other behavioural assessment. This edited book provides an overview of the ongoing research on affective computing applications in healthcare using AI and IoT. This book covers recent advancements in computing technology, modelling methods, frameworks, and algorithms used for human affect detection using bio-signal and image processing methods. The book explores the use of EEG signals, thermal imaging, eye-movement patterns, gesture recognition systems and IoT systems to gather information and discusses the use of deep learning, CNN and RNN-LSTM models of how this information can be usefully processed to detect emotional states. Discussing the latest trends and developments in research in the field, this book is a useful resource for researchers in affective computing, affective neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, computer vision, signal and image processing, cybersecurity, AI/ML/DL, data science, HCI, sensing and robotics. Practicing physicians, clinical experts or researchers in experimental and applied cognitive psychology who wish to understand the emotional wellbeing (pain and stress level analysis) of patients may also find this book of interest. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional neural nets; Deep learning (artificial intelligence); Deep learning (artificial intelligence); Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Emotion recognition; Emotion recognition; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image classification; Learning (artificial intelligence); Medical signal processing; Medical signal processing","","","","","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","","","","","","9781839537318; 9781839537325","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200947378"

The system displays the remote attendee’s facial expressions as distinct emoticons to facilitate the child’s understanding of non-verbal social cues and suggests appropriate responses on demand based on the conversational context and the detected expressions. A gamification option for practicing facial expression recognition in an engaging manner is also offered. The application serves as a support platform as well as a teaching tool which autistic children can utilize to connect with friends and caregivers to improve their social communication skills. It is being developed in consultation with therapists who work with autistic children to ensure that its design is compatible with the unique needs of the end users. The system is more cost-effective and sensory friendly as compared to similar robotic and virtual reality-based solutions and has the added advantage that the child converses with a real human being instead of a robot or a virtual agent, thus, increasing the likelihood that the social skills learned would be effectively transferred to co-located face-to-face conversations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children; Communication Skills; Education; Generative AI; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Facial Expression Recognition; Social Skills","Computational linguistics; Cost effectiveness; Face recognition; Virtual reality; Autism spectrum disorders; Autistic children; Child; Communication skills; Communication support; Facial expression recognition; Generative AI; Language model; Social communications; Social skills; Computer vision","","","Gurbuz, Emine, University Students with Autism: The Social and Academic Experiences of University in the UK, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 49, 2, pp. 617-631, (2019); Soares, Erin E., Social Skills Training for Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Meta-analysis of In-person and Technological Interventions, Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science, 6, 1, pp. 166-180, (2021); Adams, Lucy, Autistic young people’s experiences of remote psychological interventions during COVID-19, Autism, 27, 6, pp. 1616-1627, (2023); Costescu, Cristina Anamaria, Reversal Learning Task in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Robot-Based Approach, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45, 11, pp. 3715-3725, (2015); Kim, Elizabeth S., Social robots as embedded reinforcers of social behavior in children with autism, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43, 5, pp. 1038-1049, (2013); Robins, Ben, From isolation to communication: A case study evaluation of robot assisted play for children with autism with a minimally expressive humanoid robot, pp. 205-211, (2009); Gómez Esteban, Pablo Gómez, How to build a supervised autonomous system for robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorder, Paladyn, 8, 1, pp. 18-38, (2017); Yun, Sangseok, A robot-assisted behavioral intervention system for children with autism spectrum disorders, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 76, pp. 58-67, (2016); Abu-Amara, Fadi, Robot and virtual reality-based intervention in autism: a comprehensive review, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 13, 5, pp. 1879-1891, (2021); Saleh, Mohammed Ahmed, Robot applications for autism: a comprehensive review, Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology, 16, 6, pp. 580-602, (2021)","Miesenberger, K.; Peňáz, P.; Kobayashi, M.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","19th International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs, ICCHP 2024","","Linz","315249","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200384199"

Our target application is the assistance to people with motor disabilities and potential cognitive impairments, using assistive robotics. Our proposal leverages the analysis of human attention captured in the form of gaze fixations recorded by an eye-tracker on the first person video, as the anticipation of prehension actions is a well studied and well known phenomenon. We propose a multi-task system that simultaneously addresses the prediction of human attention in the near future, and the anticipation of grasping actions. Visual attention is modeled as a competitive process between a discrete set of states, each one associated to a well-known gaze movement pattern from visual psychology. We additionally consider an asymmetric multi-task problem, where attention modeling is an auxiliary task that helps to regularize the learning process of the main action prediction task, and propose a constrained multi-task loss that naturally deals with this asymmetry. Our model shows superior performance than other losses for dynamic multi-task learning, current dominant deep architectures for general action forecasting and particularly-tailored models for predicting grasping intention. In particular, it provides state-of-the-art performance in three datasets for egocentric action anticipation, with an average precision of 0.569 and 0.524 in GITW and Sharon datasets, respectively, and an accuracy of 89.2% and a success rate of 51.7% in Invisible dataset. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained loss; grasping action forecasting; interpretable attention; multi-task learning","Behavioral research; Eye tracking; Hidden Markov models; Job analysis; Learning systems; Video cameras; Constrained loss; Eye trackers; Grasping; Grasping action forecasting; Hidden-Markov models; Human attention; Interpretable attention prediction; Multitask learning; Predictive models; Task analysis; Forecasting; accuracy; algorithm; anticipation; Article; asymmetric multi task learning; attention; cognition; cognitive defect; eye movement; forecasting; gaze; grasping action forecasting; human; human experiment; image segmentation; interpretable gaze; learning; mathematical model; prediction; psychology; robotics; task performance; visual attention; visual field; eye fixation; eye-tracking technology; hand strength; physiology; Attention; Eye-Tracking Technology; Fixation, Ocular; Hand Strength; Humans; Task Performance and Analysis","","","Abal-Fernández, Silvia, Learning RL policies for anticipative assistive robots by simulating human-robot interactions in real scenarios using egocentric videos, (2023); González, Iván, Perceptually-guided deep neural networks for ego-action prediction: Object grasping, Pattern Recognition, 88, pp. 223-235, (2019); Mick, Sebastien, Shoulder kinematics plus contextual target information enable control of multiple distal joints of a simulated prosthetic arm and hand, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, 18, 1, (2021); Segas, Effie, Intuitive movement-based prosthesis control enables arm amputees to reach naturally in virtual reality, eLife, 12, (2023); Springs of Action, (1992); Pacherie, Élisabeth, The phenomenology of action: A conceptual framework, Cognition, 107, 1, pp. 179-217, (2008); Liu, Yuanzhong, Motion-Driven Visual Tempo Learning for Video-Based Action Recognition, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 31, pp. 4104-4116, (2022); Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, (1979); Intention Plans and Practical Reason, (1987); Malle, Bertram F., The folk concept of intentionality, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 33, 2, pp. 101-121, (1997)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21682208; 21682194","","ITIBF","39024089","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199085510"

Historically, rehabilitation strategies post-stroke occur separately in terms of motor and cognitive functions. However, recent studies show that hand motor interventions can have a positive impact on cognitive recovery. In this work, we introduce AMBER (portAble and Modular device for comprehensive Brain Evaluation and Rehabilitation), a new device developed for the evaluation and rehabilitation of both hand motor function and cognition simultaneously. AMBER is a simple, portable, ergonomic and cheap device based on Force Sensitive Resistors, in which every finger interaction is recorded to provide information about finger strength, processing speed, and memory status. This paper presents the requirements of the device and the design of the system. In addition, a pilot study was conducted with 36 healthy individuals using the evaluation module of the device to assess its psychometric properties, as test-retest reliability and measurement error. Its validity was also evaluated comparing its measurements with three different gold standards for strength, processing speed and memory. The device showed good test-retest reliability for strength (ICC = 0.741-0.852), reaction time (ICC = 0.715 – 0.900) and memory (ICC = 0.556-0.885). These measures were correlated with their corresponding gold standards (r = 0.780-890). AMBER shows great potential to impact hand rehabilitation, offering therapists a valid, reliable and versatile tool to comprehensively assess patients. With ongoing advancements and refinements, it has the opportunity to significantly impact rehabilitation practices and improve patient outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cognitive evaluation; cognitive status; Hand; hand evaluation; rehabilitation; robotics; stroke; upper limb","Amber; Patient rehabilitation; Robotics; Cognitive evaluation; Cognitive status; Hand; Hand evaluation; Motor function; Portable device; Processing speed; Stroke; Test-retest reliability; Upper limbs; Function evaluation; polyethylene terephthalate; adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; female; hand function; hand motor function; hand strength; human; male; Montreal cognitive assessment; motor performance; neurorehabilitation; pilot study; pinch strength; proof of concept; reaction time; robotics; test retest reliability; upper limb; validity; working memory; devices; equipment design; finger; hand; memory; middle aged; normal human; physiology; procedures; psychometry; reproducibility; stroke rehabilitation; young adult; Adult; Cognition; Cognitive Training; Equipment Design; Female; Fingers; Hand Strength; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Proof of Concept Study; Psychometrics; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke Rehabilitation; Young Adult","","polyethylene terephthalate, 25038-59-9, 60527-88-0, 9003-68-3","Feigin, Valery L., Global, regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk factors, 1990-2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, The Lancet Neurology, 20, 10, pp. 1-26, (2021); Cramer, Steven C., A functional MRI study of subjects recovered from hemiparetic stroke, Stroke, 28, 12, pp. 2518-2527, (1997); Parker, V.

Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","competency-based education; Complex thinking; computational thinking; data visualization; educational innovation; higher education","Anthropomorphic robots; Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Academic program; Competency-based education; Complex thinking; Computational thinkings; Cultural heritages; Educational innovations; Engineering curriculum; High educations; Real-world; Social support; Data visualization","","","Juárez Martínez, E.

However, there is limited understanding regarding whether children with ASD can learn directly from the testimony of social robots and whether they can remain vigilant based on the perceived accuracy of these robots. Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine whether children with ASD demonstrated selective trust towards social robots. Methods: Twenty-nine children with ASD between ages of 4–7 years, and 38 typically-developing (TD) age and IQ-matched peers participated in classic selective trust tasks. During the tasks, they learned the names of novel objects from either a pair of social robots or a pair of human informants, where one informant had previously been established as accurate and the other inaccurate. Results: Children with ASD trusted information from an accurate social robot over an inaccurate one, similar to their performance with human informants. However, compared to TD children, children with ASD exhibited lower levels of selective trust regardless of the type of informants they learned from. Conclusions: Our study suggests that children with ASD can selectively trust and acquire knowledge from social robots, shedding light on the potential use of social robots in supporting individuals with ASD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autism spectrum disorder; Prior accuracy; Selective trust; Social robots","","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2000); Auyeung, Bonnie, The autism spectrum quotient: Children's version (AQ-Child), Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, 7, pp. 1230-1240, (2008); Breazeal, Cynthia L., Young Children Treat Robots as Informants, Topics in Cognitive Science, 8, 2, pp. 481-491, (2016); Brink, Kimberly A., Robot teachers for children?

By collaborating with schools featuring intensive support for inclusive schooling (SIEI), the project designs activities using SAR interactions, gradually transitioning from robot-centered to human-centered interactions to enhance inclusivity. The project employs a user-centered design methodology, involving multidisciplinary teams and parental input, to tailor five interventions based on individual needs and abilities.

The importance of early intervention has been widely demonstrated, and developmental trajectories in ASD emphasize the importance of nonverbal communication, such as intransitive gesture production, as a possible positive prognostic factor for language development. The use of technological tools in the therapy of individuals with ASD has also become increasingly important due to their higher engagement and responsiveness to technological objects, such as robots. Materials and methods: We developed a training protocol using the humanoid robot NAO, called IOGIOCO (Interactive mirroring Games wIth sOCial rObot), based on the use of intransitive gestures embedded in naturalistic dialogues, stimulating a triadic interaction between child, robot and therapist. The training was divided into six levels; the first 2 levels were called “familiarization levels,” and the other 4 were “training levels”. The technological setup includes different complexity levels, from mirroring tasks to building spontaneous interactions. We tested the protocol on 10 preschool children with ASD (aged 2-6 years) for 14 weeks. We assessed them at recruitment (T0), at the end of training (T1), and after 6 months (T2). Results: We demonstrated the tolerability of the protocol. We found that one group (n=4, males and 2 females) reached the training level, while another and group (n=6 males) remained at a familiarization level (mirroring), we analyzed the results for the two groups. In the group that reached the training levels, we found promising results, such as an improvement in the Social Adaptive Domain of the ABAS-II questionnaire between T0 and T2. Conclusion: While current results will need a Randomized Controlled Trial to be confirmed, the present work sets an important milestone in using social robots for ASD treatment, aimed at impacting social and communication skills in everyday life. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorders; children; communicative gestures; social robot; technological rehabilitation","adaptive behaviour assessment system questionnaire; adult; aged; Article; autism; child; cognition; familiarization level; female; game; gesture; human; human experiment; interactive mirroring game; interpersonal communication; intransitive gesture; Italian (citizen); language development; male; middle aged; pilot study; preschool child; protocol; psychomotor activity; questionnaire; speech therapy","","","Nervous Child, (1943); Bailey, Anthony J., Autism: Towards an integration of clinical, genetic, neuropsychological, and neurobiological perspectives, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 37, 1, pp. 89-126, (1996); Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Scattoni, Maria Luisa, Autism spectrum disorder prevalence in Italy: a nationwide study promoted by the Ministry of Health, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, 17, 1, (2023); Daniels, Amy M., Approaches to enhancing the early detection of autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review of the literature, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 53, 2, pp. 141-152, (2014); Petrocchi, Serena, Systematic review of level 1 and level 2 screening tools for autism spectrum disorders in toddlers, Brain Sciences, 10, 3, (2020); Lecciso, Flavia, Preliminary evidence of the structural validity and measurement invariance of the Quantitative-CHecklist for Autism in toddler (Q-CHAT) on Italian unselected children, Electronic Journal of Applied Statistical Analysis, 12, 2, pp. 320-340, (2019); Ruta, Liliana, Validation of the Quantitative CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) in an Italian clinical sample of young children with Autism and Other Developmental Disorders, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 10, JUN, (2019); Lord, Catherine E., Autism spectrum disorder, The Lancet, 392, 10146, pp. 508-520, (2018); Charman, Tony, Measuring early language development in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder using the MacArthur communicative development inventory (Infant Form), Journal of Child Language, 30, 1, pp. 213-236, (2003)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","16640640","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198466480"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most versatile and quickly growing areas of robotic control, and has been used for a variety of different robots and tasks. One potential use of robotics and AI is in that of childhood development. Cooperative play has been shown to be a crucial part of childhood development, and for children with developmental disabilities, playing with other children may be difficult and frustrating, leading them to miss out on this important milestone. Cooperative play with robots has been shown to have positive educational and therapeutic effects on children with developmental disabilities, and so robots can be used as substitute players for children who have troubles playing with other children. To achieve this, AI algorithms must be developed that can make appropriate decisions or moves for a given game, to such an extent that the children would choose to play with the robot instead of alone. In this paper two AI agents are developed to play Menara, a cooperative tower building game. The two agents include a pillar placement agent and a tile placement agent. They implement algorithms including the method for selecting the pillars to have available to the agent during gameplay, and how many pillars the agent plans to place in a single turn. The tile placement agent was able to successfully balance a tile 62% of the time, while the pillar placement agent was able to succeed 88% of the time on the test dataset. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; E-learning; Intelligent agents; Intelligent robots; Reinforcement learning; Robot programming; Statistical tests; Artificial intelligence agent; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Childhood development; Decisions makings; Developmental disability; Gameplay; Reinforcement learning agent; Robotic controls; Therapeutic effects; Tower building; Decision making","","","Garcia, Elena, The evolution of robotics research, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 14, 1, pp. 90-103, (2007); Matthias, Björn, Injury risk quantification for industrial robots in collaborative operation with humans, 1, pp. 171-176, (2010); Elliott Fahlman, Scott, A planning system for robot construction tasks, Artificial Intelligence, 5, 1, pp. 1-49, (1974); Wang, Jiuguang, Robot Jenga: Autonomous and strategic block extraction, pp. 5248-5253, (2009); Soviet Psychology, (1967); Ferrari, Ester, Therapeutic and educational objectives in robot assisted play for children with autism, pp. 108-114, (2009); Robins, Ben, From isolation to communication: A case study evaluation of robot assisted play for children with autism with a minimally expressive humanoid robot, pp. 205-211, (2009); Wainer, Joshua, Using the humanoid robot KASPAR to autonomously play triadic games and facilitate collaborative play among children with autism, IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development, 6, 3, pp. 183-199, (2014); Szita, István, Reinforcement learning in games, Adaptation, Learning, and Optimization, 12, pp. 539-577, (2012); Isele, David, Navigating Occluded Intersections with Autonomous Vehicles Using Deep Reinforcement Learning, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2034-2039, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Systems Council","18th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, SysCon 2024","","Montreal; QC","200323","","9798350358803","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197354670"

Introducing these technologies to the classroom aims to offer possibilities of social and educational inclusion. While implementation is still at an experimental level, several of these avatars have already been introduced as a marketable service. However, various obstacles impede widespread acceptance. Methods: In our explorative qualitative case study we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight individuals involved in the implementation of the avatar robots AV1 in Germany and eleven participants involved with implementing OriHime in Japan. We analyzed and compared implementation processes, application areas, access and eligibility, and the potential and limitations of avatars at schools. Results: We identified structural similarities and differences in both countries. In the German cases the target is defined as temporary use for children who cannot attend school in person because of childhood illness, with the clear goal of returning to school. Whereas in Japan OriHime is also implemented for children with physical or developmental disabilities, or who cannot attend school in person for other reasons. Discussion: Our study suggests that avatar technologies bear high potential for children to stay socially and educationally connected. Yet, structures need establishing that grant equal access to avatar technologies. These include educational board regulations, budgets for funding avatar technologies and making them accessible to the public, and privacy protection standards that are adequate, yet do not create implementation hurdles that are too high. Furthermore, guidelines or training sessions on technical, educational and psychosocial aspects of including avatar technologies in the classroom for teachers are important for successful implementation. Since our Japanese cases suggest that expanding the area of application beyond childhood illness is promising, further research on the benefits for different groups is needed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","avatar robots; childhood illness; children with disabilities; Germany; Japan; school absenteeism; telepresence robots","Article; clinical assessment; data collection method; drug industry; e-mail; Germany; health care access; health care personnel; hospitalization; human; interview; Japan; medical education; physical development; practice guideline; process optimization; psychosocial care; qualitative analysis; school; semi structured interview; staying connected; telecommunication; training; videoconferencing","","","Weibel, Mette, Back to school with telepresence robot technology: A qualitative pilot study about how telepresence robots help school-aged children and adolescents with cancer to remain socially and academically connected with their school classes during treatment, Nursing Open, 7, 4, pp. 988-997, (2020); Weibel, Mette, Telepresence robots to reduce school absenteeism among children with cancer, neuromuscular diseases, or anxiety—the expectations of children and teachers: A qualitative study in Denmark, Computers in Human Behavior Reports, 10, (2023); Ahumada-Newhart, Veronica, Virtual inclusion via telepresence robots in the classroom: An exploratory case study, International Journal of Technologies in Learning, 23, 4, pp. 9-25, (2016); undefined, (2016); Page, Angela, Telepresence Robot Use for Children with Chronic Illness in Australian Schools: A Scoping Review and Thematic Analysis, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 6, pp. 1281-1293, (2021); Ahumada-Newhart, Veronica, My student is a robot: How schools manage telepresence experiences for students, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2017-May, pp. 342-347, (2017); Williams, Laurel A., Using PEBBLES to facilitate remote communication and learning, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 1, pp. 320-324, (1997); Herring, Susan C., The future of robotic telepresence: Visions, opportunities and challenges, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 07-12-May-2016, pp. 1038-1042, (2016); Weiss, Patrice Tamar L., PEBBLES: A personal technology for meeting educational, social and emotional needs of hospitalised children, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 5, 3, pp. 157-168, (2001); Johannessen, Lars Emil Fagernes, Protocol for 'virtual presence': A qualitative study of the cultural dialectic between loneliness and technology, BMJ Open, 11, 9, (2021)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","2673253X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196312080"

The proposed methodology integrates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to optimize the performance of robotic interventions. The data collection phase involves compiling a comprehensive image dataset capturing facial expressions, gestures, and relevant visual cues associated with ASD. Leveraging robotic platforms designed for therapeutic interventions, feature extraction techniques identify intricate patterns within the data. Advanced algorithms, including GAs, classify the dataset into positive (ASD) and negative (non-ASD) categories. The framework introduces a Diagnosis Matrix for enhanced diagnostic precision, correlating observed robotic interactions with clinical assessments. An Ontology Knowledge base adapts responses based on evolving patient needs. The proposed method surpasses all others, achieving an accuracy of 95.08% and demonstrating superior precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. This indicates the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving a well-balanced performance with high accuracy and robustness in correctly identifying positive instances.

However existing systems often rely on hand gestures, which can be restrictive and less accessible for users with cognitive disability. This paper introduces a multi-modal command input, which combines voice and deictic postures, to create a natural humanrobot interaction. In addition, we combine our system with a chatbot to make the interaction responsive. The demonstrated deictic postures, voice and the perceived table-top scene are processed in real-time to extract the human’s intention. The system is evaluated for increasingly complex tasks using a real Universal Robots UR3e 6-DoF robot arm. The preliminary results demonstrate a high success rate in task completion and a notable improvement compared to gesture-based systems. Controlling robots through multi-modal commands, as opposed to gesture control, can save up to 48.1% of the time taken to issue commands to the robot. Our system adeptly integrates the advantages of voice commands and deictic postures to facilitate intuitive human-robot interaction. Compared to conventional gesture control methods, our approach requires minimal training, eliminating the need to memorize complex gestures, and results in shorter interaction times. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human-Robot collaboration; Intent recognition; Multi-Modal control","Collaborative robots; Man machine systems; Aging population; Elder care; Gesture control; Human-robot collaboration; Humans-robot interactions; Intent recognition; Multi modal control; Multi-modal; Quality of life; Cognitive systems","","","undefined; Babour, Amal J., Intelligent gloves: An IT intervention for deaf-mute people, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 32, 1, (2023); Cao, Zhe, Realtime multi-person 2D pose estimation using part affinity fields, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 1302-1310, (2017); Cheng, Hu, A Vision-Based Robot Grasping System, IEEE Sensors Journal, 22, 10, pp. 9610-9620, (2022); Enan, Sadman Sakib, Robotic Detection of a Human-Comprehensible Gestural Language for Underwater Multi-Human-Robot Collaboration, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2022-October, pp. 3085-3092, (2022); Ende, Tobias, A human-centered approach to robot gesture based communication within collaborative working processes, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 3367-3374, (2011); Proceedings of the International Multiconference Eng Comput Sci, (2014); Krupke, Dennis, Comparison of Multimodal Heading and Pointing Gestures for Co-Located Mixed Reality Human-Robot Interaction, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5003-5009, (2018); undefined; Mazhar, Osama, Towards Real-Time Physical Human-Robot Interaction Using Skeleton Information and Hand Gestures, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 7336-7341, (2018)","Filipe, J.; Röning, J.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","4th International Conference on Robotics, Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems, ROBOVIS 2024","","Rome","312179","18650937; 18650929","9789819671748; 9789819664610; 9783032026743; 9783032008831; 9783032026712; 9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9789819666874; 9783031936968; 9783031941207","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194084616"

Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is effective in enhancing the social skills of children with ASD, and interventions using social robots are potentially beneficial training tools. However, it is uncertain whether robots can facilitate more effective training for children with ASD compared to human therapists. Methods: In the present study, we compared the effectiveness of robot-based and human-based interventions on enhancing the social communication behaviors in young children diagnosed with ASD. The feasibility and efficacy of integrating the PECS in robotic systems were evaluated using a single-case design. Eight children with ASD were randomly assigned to either a robot-based group (N = 4) or a human-based group (N = 4). Participants in the two groups underwent phases I–III of the PECS protocol facilitated by either a human therapist or a robot therapist. Changes in social communication behaviors were assessed in each child after intervention using a single-case design. Results: Half of the participants in the robot-based intervention group showed significant improvement in both verbal and nonverbal communication behaviors after a two-month PECS intervention. A higher proportion of children in the robot-based intervention group showed significantly enhanced social communication skills encompassing both verbal and nonverbal behaviors than in the human-based intervention group.

Despite the recent progress, the data uncertainty issue, reflected as the content evolution process and dynamic correlation in event labels, has been somehow ignored. This reduces the model generalization ability and deep understanding on video content, leading to serious error accumulation and degraded performance. In this paper, we address the uncertainty learning problem and propose an uncertainty-boosted robust video activity anticipation framework, which generates uncertainty values to indicate the credibility of the anticipation results. The uncertainty value is used to derive a temperature parameter in the softmax function to modulate the predicted target activity distribution. To guarantee the distribution adjustment, we construct a reasonable target activity label representation by incorporating the activity evolution from the temporal class correlation and the semantic relationship. Moreover, we quantify the uncertainty into relative values by comparing the uncertainty among sample pairs and their temporal-lengths. This relative strategy provides a more accessible way in uncertainty modeling than quantifying the absolute uncertainty values on the whole dataset. Experiments on multiple backbones and benchmarks show our framework achieves promising performance and better robustness/interpretability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data uncertainty; relative uncertainty learning; robustness; Video activity anticipation","Job analysis; Learning systems; Robustness (control systems); Semantics; Uncertainty analysis; Computational modelling; Context models; Data uncertainty; Predictive models; Relative uncertainty; Relative uncertainty learning; Robustness; Task analysis; Uncertainty; Video activity; Video activity anticipation; Benchmarking; anticipation; article; benchmarking; degradation; learning disorder; pharmacology; temperature; uncertainty; videorecording","","","de Geest, Roeland, Online action detection, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9909 LNCS, pp. 269-284, (2016); Koppula, Hema Swetha, Anticipating Human Activities Using Object Affordances for Reactive Robotic Response, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 38, 1, pp. 14-29, (2016); Hutchinson, Matthew S., Video action understanding, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 134611-134637, (2021); Abu Farha, Yazan, When will you do what? - Anticipating Temporal Occurrences of Activities, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5343-5352, (2018); Furnari, Antonino, What would you expect? anticipating egocentric actions with rolling-unrolling LSTMS and modality attention, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 6251-6260, (2019); Qi, Zhaobo, Self-Regulated Learning for Egocentric Video Activity Anticipation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 45, 6, pp. 6715-6730, (2023); Zatsarynna, Olga, Multi-modal temporal convolutional network for anticipating actions in egocentric videos, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 2249-2258, (2021); Camporese, Guglielmo, Knowledge distillation for action anticipation via label smoothing, Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 3312-3319, (2020); Fernando, Basura, Anticipating human actions by correlating past with the future with Jaccard similarity measures, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 13219-13228, (2021); Qi, Siyuan, Predicting Human Activities Using Stochastic Grammar, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017-October, pp. 1173-1181, (2017)","","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","01628828","","ITPID","38683715","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192195702"

It serves as a form of the Turing test, aimed at detecting robotic involvement in web security breaches and distinguishing them from human users. This test is particularly valuable for web-based applications to prevent unauthorized activities, automated access, and potential harm caused by robots. CAPTCHA takes various forms, including deformed text, mathematical puzzles, OTP (One Time Password), audio challenges, 3D visualizations, graphical puzzles, and gaming challenges. Gaming CAPTCHA, in particular, has gained popularity as a highly secure option. These CAPTCHAs often present users with simple logical tasks, such as dragging objects to designated positions, while some may pose significant challenges even for humans due to their complexity. The effectiveness of a CAPTCHA lies in its ability to be easily solvable by humans within a short timeframe, making it nearly impossible for robots to crack. However, there is a constant need for improved CAPTCHA systems that can offer higher accuracy and require intellectual efforts from users to solve queries. This paper aims to address these requirements by offering CAPTCHA challenges that demand logical thinking, making them easily solvable by humans but challenging for robots. The game-based interface of the proposed system is visually appealing and interactive, encouraging users to solve CAPTCHAs without frustration. The development of CAPTCHA and the enhancement of web accessibility are crucial for ensuring a positive user experience for all internet users, including those with learning disabilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CAPTCHA; cyber security; dyslexia; Game-based Captcha; learning disabilities; user experience","Cybersecurity; Electronic mail filters; Network security; Software testing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Websites; CAPTCHAs; Cyber security; Dynamic game; Dyslexium; Game-Based; Game-based captchum; Learning disabilities; Turing tests; Users' experiences; Robots","","","von Ahn, Luis, reCAPTCHA: Human-based character recognition via web security measures, Science, 321, 5895, pp. 1465-1468, (2008); International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, (2018); Journal of Accessibility Studies, (2019); Journal of Usability Studies, (2015); IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, (2008); International Journal of Human Computer Interaction, (2018); von Ahn, Luis, Telling humans and computers apart automatically, Communications of the ACM, 47, 2, pp. 56-60, (2004); Yan, Jeff, A low-cost attack on a microsoft CAPTCHA, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 543-554, (2008); Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, (2010); Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, (2011)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on Disruptive Technologies, ICDT 2024","","Greater Noida; GL Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management","198772","","9798350371055","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191251938"

Still, the great bulk of SAR research has been restricted to brief investigations in extremely controlled settings. Engineering and computer hurdles abound in the design and implementation of a SAR system that can interact autonomously in situ for extended periods of time. The creation of a completely autonomous SAR system for long-term in-home usage with children diagnosed with ASD is presented in this work. This paper designs and evaluates the embedded system for Autism Spectrum Disorder children. These children face difficulties from the communication barrier, mood swings, hyperactivity, and learning basics. A mobile social Robot for autistic children detects emotions.

These are the fundamental elements characterizing the fourth and the fifth industrial revolutions (4IR, 5IR): the crucial innovation is the adoption of intelligent technologies that can allow the development of cyber-physical systems, similar if not superior to humans. The common wisdom is that intelligence might be provided by AI (Artificial Intelligence), a claim that is supported more by media coverage and commercial interests than by solid scientific evidence. AI is currently conceived in a quite broad sense, encompassing LLMs and a lot of other things, without any unifying principle, but self-motivating for the success in various areas. The current view of AI robotics mostly follows a purely disembodied approach that is consistent with the old-fashioned, Cartesian mind-body dualism, reflected in the software-hardware distinction inherent to the von Neumann computing architecture. The working hypothesis of this position paper is that the road to the next generation of autonomous robotic agents with cognitive capabilities requires a fully brain-inspired, embodied cognitive approach that avoids the trap of mind-body dualism and aims at the full integration of Bodyware and Cogniware. We name this approach Artificial Cognition (ACo) and ground it in Cognitive Neuroscience. It is specifically focused on proactive knowledge acquisition based on bidirectional human-robot interaction: the practical advantage is to enhance generalization and explainability. Moreover, we believe that a brain-inspired network of interactions is necessary for allowing humans to cooperate with artificial cognitive agents, building a growing level of personal trust and reciprocal accountability: this is clearly missing, although actively sought, in current AI. The ACo approach is a work in progress that can take advantage of a number of research threads, some of them antecedent the early attempts to define AI concepts and methods. In the rest of the paper we will consider some of the building blocks that need to be re-visited in a unitary framework: the principles of developmental robotics, the methods of action representation with prospection capabilities, and the crucial role of social interaction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","body model; developmental robotics; embodied cognition; neural simulation of actions; self-organization; social robotics","Brain; Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Intelligent agents; Intelligent robots; 'current; Autonomous robotics; Body models; Developmental robotics; Embodied cognition; Neural simulation of action; Neural simulations; Robotic agents; Self organizations; Social robotics; Human robot interaction; Article; artificial cognition; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; automation; autonomous robotic agent; autonomous vehicle; behavior; brain development; cognition; cognitive neuroscience; connectome; default mode network; episodic memory; human; intelligence; learning; lifelong learning; locomotion; machine learning; neural simulation; personality; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; robotics; semantics; simulation; social interaction; social support; visual attention; working memory","","","Adadi, Amina, Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Aglioti, S.

It positively correlates with many aspects such as learning, social support, and acceptance. Facial emotion recognition using artificial intelligence can be beneficial to automatically measure individual engagement especially when using automated learning and playing modalities such as using Robots. In this study, we proposed an automatic engagement detection model through facial emotional recognition, particularly in determining autistic children’s engagement. The methodology employed a transfer learning approach at the dataset level, utilizing facial image datasets from typically developing (TD) children and children with ASD. The classification task was performed using convolutional neural network (CNN) methods. Comparative analysis revealed that the CNN method demonstrated superior accuracy compared to random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree algorithms in both the TD and ASD datasets. The findings highlight the potential of CNN-based facial emotion recognition for accurately assessing engagement in children with ASD, with implications for enhancing learning, social support, and acceptance in this population. This research contributes to the field of engagement measurement in autism and underscores the importance of leveraging AI techniques for improving understanding and support for children with ASD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autistic children; convolutional neural networks; Engagement detection; facial emotion recognition","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Diseases; Face recognition; Intelligent robots; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Support vector machines; Autism spectrum disorders; Autistic children; Convolutional neural network; Emotion recognition; Engagement detection; Facial emotion recognition; Facial emotions; Neural network method; Social acceptance; Social support; Emotion Recognition","","","Affective Engagement A Person Centred Approach to Understanding the Structure of Subjective Learning Experiences, (2004); Banire, Bilikis, Face-Based Attention Recognition Model for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Journal of Healthcare Informatics Research, 5, 4, pp. 420-445, (2021); Schulc, Attila, Automatic measurement of visual attention to video content using deep learning, (2019); Sharma, Samata R., Autism Spectrum Disorder: Classification, diagnosis and therapy, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 190, pp. 91-104, (2018); Frontiers in Robotics and AI, (2021); Di Nuovo, Alessandro, Deep learning systems for estimating visual attention in robot-assisted therapy of children with autism and intellectual disability, Robotics, 7, 2, (2018); Khan, Maliha, Face Detection and Recognition Using OpenCV, 2019-January, pp. 116-119, (2019); Liu, Weibo, A survey of deep neural network architectures and their applications, Neurocomputing, 234, pp. 11-26, (2017); Foxx, Richard M., Applied Behavior Analysis Treatment of Autism: The State of the Art, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 17, 4, pp. 821-834, (2008); Salmam, Fatima Zahra, Facial Expression Recognition Using Decision Trees, pp. 125-130, (2016)","","Science and Information Organization","","","","","","21565570; 2158107X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189935146"

Robot-based multiplayer gaming with virtual and haptic interaction may improve motivation, engagement, and implicit learning in robotic therapy. Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in robot mediated haptic dyads, or human-robot-robot-human interaction. The effect of such a paradigm on motor learning in general and specifically for individuals with motor and/or cognitive impairments is an open area of research. We reviewed the literature to investigate the effect of a robot-based haptic dyad on motor learning. Thirty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. We summarize study characteristics including device, haptic rendering, and experimental task. Our main findings indicate that dyadic training's impact on motor learning is inconsistent in that some studies show significant improvement of motor training while others show no influence. We also find that the relative skill level of the partner and interaction characteristics such as stiffness of connection and availability of visual information influence motor learning outcomes. We discuss implications for neurorehabilitation and conclude that additional research is needed to determine optimal interaction characteristics for motor learning and to extend this research to individuals with cognitive and motor impairments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","haptic dyad; Haptics; human robot human interaction; human robot interaction; multiplayer therapy games; neurological impairments; neurorehabilitation; robotics","Human robot interaction; Job analysis; Man machine systems; Game; Haptic dyad; Haptics; Haptics interfaces; Human robot human interaction; Human robots; Humans-robot interactions; Multiplayer therapy game; Multiplayers; Neurological impairment; Neurorehabilitation []; Robot-human interaction; Task analysis; Haptic interfaces; devices; human; learning; motor performance; neurorehabilitation; physiology; procedures; robotics; touch; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Neurological Rehabilitation; Robotics; Touch Perception","","","Cieza, Alarcos, Global estimates of the need for rehabilitation based on the Global Burden of Disease study 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, The Lancet, 396, 10267, pp. 2006-2017, (2020); Jesus, Tiago S., Global need for physical rehabilitation: Systematic analysis from the global burden of disease study 2017, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 6, (2019); Kamenov, Kaloyan, Needs and unmet needs for rehabilitation services: a scoping review, Disability and Rehabilitation, 41, 10, pp. 1227-1237, (2019); Hogan, Neville, Motions or muscles?

Combining natural play with quantitative measurements of developmental milestones can be an effective way to swiftly and efficiently detect infants who are at risk of neurodevelopmental delays. Clinical studies have established differences in toy interaction behaviors between full-term infants and pre-term infants who are at risk for cerebral palsy and other developmental disorders. Methods: The proposed toy aims to improve the quantitative assessment of infant-toy interactions and fully automate the process of detecting those infants at risk of developing motor delays. This paper describes the design and development of a toy that uniquely utilizes a collection of soft lossy force sensors which are developed using optical fibers to gather play interaction data from infants laying supine in a gym. An example interaction database was created by having 15 adults complete a total of 2480 interactions with the toy consisting of 620 touches, 620 punches—“kick substitute,” 620 weak grasps and 620 strong grasps. Results: The data is analyzed for patterns of interaction with the toy face using a machine learning model developed to classify the four interactions present in the database. Results indicate that the configuration of 6 soft force sensors on the face created unique activation patterns. Discussion: The machine learning algorithm was able to identify the distinct action types from the data, suggesting the potential usability of the toy. Next steps involve sensorizing the entire toy and testing with infants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assessment; infant-toy interactions; machine learning; pediatric; rehabilitation; robotics; smart toy; soft force sensor","","","","Barlow, Steven Michael, Wireless sensing of lower lip and thumb-index finger ‘ramp-and-hold’ isometric force dynamics in a small cohort of unilateral MCA stroke: Discussion of preliminary findings, Sensors, 20, 4, (2020); Bobin, Maxence, Design and study of a smart cup for monitoring the arm and hand activity of stroke patients, IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine, 6, (2018); Bosanquet, Margot, A systematic review of tests to predict cerebral palsy in young children, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 55, 5, pp. 418-426, (2013); Cecchi, Francesca, CareToy: An intelligent baby gym, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 23, 4, pp. 63-72, (2016); Chambers, Claire, Computer vision to automatically assess infant neuromotor risk, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 28, 11, pp. 2431-2442, (2020); Soares-Marangoni, Daniele Almeida, Differences between late preterm and full-term infants: Comparing effects of a short bout of practice on early reaching behavior, Research in Developmental Disabilities, 35, 11, pp. 3096-3107, (2014); Deng, Weiyang, Differences in spontaneous leg movement patterns between infants with typical development and infants at risk for developmental delay: Cross-sectional observation prior to sitting onset, Journal of Motor Learning and Development, 6, 1, pp. 101-113, (2018); Gerber, R.

Objective: We aimed to present examples of action opportunities for (1) designing “technology”; (2) shaping the “context” of use; and (3) adjusting the behavior of “users” to guide responsible digital care for people with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Three cases were considered: (1) design of a web application to support the preparation of meals for groups of people with intellectual disabilities, (2) implementation of an app to help people with intellectual disabilities regulate their stress independently, and (3) implementation of a social robot to stimulate interaction and physical activity among people with intellectual disabilities. Overall, 26 stakeholders participated in 3 multistakeholder workshops (case 1: 10/26, 38%; case 2: 10/26, 38%; case 3: 6/26, 23%) based on the “guidance ethics approach.” We identified stakeholders’ values based on bottom-up exploration of experienced and expected effects of using the technology, and we formulated action opportunities for these values in the specific context of use. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results: Overall, 232 effects, 33 values, and 156 action opportunities were collected. General and case-specific themes were identified. Important stakeholder values included quality of care, autonomy, efficiency, health, enjoyment, reliability, and privacy. Both positive and negative effects could underlie stakeholders’ values and influence the development of action opportunities. Action opportunities comprised the following: (1) technology: development of the technology (eg, user experience and customization), technology input (eg, recipes for meals, intervention options for reducing stress, and activities), and technology output (eg, storage and use of data); (2) context: guidelines, training and support, policy or agreements, and adjusting the physical environment in which the technology is used; and (3) users: integrating the technology into daily care practice, by diminishing (eg, “letting go” to increase the autonomy of people with intellectual disabilities), retaining (eg, face-to-face contact), and adding (eg, evaluation moments) certain behaviors of care professionals. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide insight into responsible digital care for people with intellectual disabilities by means of bottom-up exploration of action opportunities to take account of stakeholders’ values in designing technology, shaping the context of use, and adjusting the behavior of users. Although part of the findings may be generalized, case-specific insights and a complementary top-down approach (eg, predefined ethical frameworks) are essential. The findings represent a part of an ethical discourse that requires follow-up to meet the dynamism of stakeholders’ values and further develop and implement action opportunities to achieve socially desirable, ethically acceptable, and sustainable digital care that improves the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital care; digital technology; ethics; intellectual disability; value-based health care","Article; controlled study; daily life activity; digital technology; experience; health; health care quality; health personnel attitude; information storage; intellectual impairment; leisure; meal; mental stress; mentally disabled person; patient autonomy; patient care; physical activity; policy; privacy; productivity; qualitative research; reliability; social interaction; software design; stakeholder engagement; training; workshop","","","Integraal Zorg Akkoord Samen Werken Aan Gezonde Zorg, (2022); Study on Health Data Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, (2022); Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020 2025, (2021); The Lancet Digital Health, A digital (r)evolution: introducing The Lancet Digital Health, The Lancet Digital Health, 1, 1, (2019); Sarri, Grammati, The Role of Patient Experience in the Value Assessment of Complex Technologies – Do HTA Bodies Need to Reconsider How Value is Assessed?, Health Policy, 125, 5, pp. 593-601, (2021); Interact J Med Res, (2022); Baltussen, Rob P.M., Value Assessment Frameworks for HTA Agencies: The Organization of Evidence-Informed Deliberative Processes, Value in Health, 20, 2, pp. 256-260, (2017); van Velsen, Lex S., Designing ehealth that matters via a multidisciplinary requirements development approach, JMIR Research Protocols, 2, 1, (2013); Baines, Rebecca L., Meaningful patient and public involvement in digital health innovation, implementation and evaluation: A systematic review, Health Expectations, 25, 4, pp. 1232-1245, (2022); Panyard, Daniel J., Bridging clinical researcher perceptions and health IT realities: A case study of stakeholder creep, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 110, pp. 19-24, (2018)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","23687959","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186894910"

Determining the optimal motion of robots when interacting with individuals with ASD is important for achieving more natural human-robot interactions and for exploiting the full potential of robotic interventions. Most prior studies have used supervised machine learning (ML) of user behavioral data to enable robot perception of affective states (i.e., arousal and valence) and engagement. It has previously been suggested that including personal demographic information in the identification of individuals with ASD is important for developing an automated system to perceive individual affective states and engagement. In this study, we hypothesized that assessing self-administered questionnaire data would contribute to the development of an automated estimation of the affective state and engagement when individuals with ASD are interviewed by an Android robot, which will be linked to implementing long-term interventions and maintaining the motivation of participants. Methods: Participants sat across a table from an android robot that played the role of the interviewer. Each participant underwent a mock job interview. Twenty-five participants with ASD (males 22, females 3, average chronological age = 22.8, average IQ = 94.04) completed the experiment. We collected multimodal data (i.e., audio, motion, gaze, and self-administered questionnaire data) to train a model to correctly classify the state of individuals with ASD when interviewed by an android robot. We demonstrated the technical feasibility of using ML to enable robot perception of affect and engagement of individuals with ASD based on multimodal data. Results: For arousal and engagement, the area under the curve (AUC) values of the model estimates and expert coding were relatively high. Overall, the AUC values of arousal, valence, and engagement were improved by including self-administered questionnaire data in the classification. Discussion: These findings support the hypothesis that assessing self-administered questionnaire data contributes to the development of an automated estimation of an individual’s affective state and engagement. Given the efficacy of including self-administered questionnaire data, future studies should confirm the effectiveness of such long-term intervention with a robot to maintain participants’ motivation based on the proposed method of emotion estimation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","affective state; autism spectrum disorders; automated estimation; machine learning; self-administered questionnaire","adult; area under the curve; Article; autism; behavior; clinical article; cognition; cognitive function test; correlation coefficient; cross validation; decision tree; emotion; feasibility study; female; gaze; human; interview; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; male; motion; motivation; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; robotic interview; self administered questionnaire; sensation seeking; sound analysis; task performance","","","Sasayama, Daimei, Trends in Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnoses in Japan, 2009 to 2019, JAMA Network Open, 4, 5, (2021); Cakir, Janet, The lifetime social cost of autism: 1990–2029, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 72, (2020); Warren, Zachary E., Can Robotic Interaction Improve Joint Attention Skills?, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45, 11, pp. 3726-3734, (2015); Johnson, Chris Plauché, Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders, Pediatrics, 120, 5, pp. 1183-1215, (2007); Karkhaneh, Mohammad, Social Stories™ to improve social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review, Autism, 14, 6, pp. 641-662, (2010); Vismara, Laurie A., Behavioral treatments in autism spectrum disorder: What do we know?, Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 6, pp. 447-468, (2010); Wass, Sam Vincent, The uses of cognitive training technologies in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, Autism, 18, 8, pp. 851-871, (2014); Pennisi, Paola, Autism and social robotics: A systematic review, Autism Research, 9, 2, pp. 165-183, (2016); Kumazaki, Hirokazu, Optimal robot for intervention for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 74, 11, pp. 581-586, (2020); Diehl, Joshua John, The clinical use of robots for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A critical review, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 6, 1, pp. 249-262, (2012)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","16640640","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185315879"

Assistive technologies (ATs) play an important role in this context and hold significant potential when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). (Objective) The objective of this study is to analyze the state of integration of AI with ATs in autism through a review. (Methods) A review was conducted on PubMed and Scopus, applying a standard checklist and a qualification process. The outcome reported 22 studies, including 7 reviews. (Key Content and Findings) The results reveal an early yet promising interest in integrating AI into autism assistive technologies. Exciting developments are currently underway at the intersection of AI and robotics, as well as in the creation of wearable automated devices like smart glasses. These innovations offer substantial potential for enhancing communication, interaction, and social engagement for individuals with autism. Presently, researchers are prioritizing innovation over establishing a solid presence within the healthcare domain, where issues such as regulation and acceptance demand increased attention. (Conclusions) As the field continues to evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that AI will play a pivotal role in bridging various domains, and integrated ATs with AI are positioned to act as crucial connectors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AAC; accessibility; AI; artificial intelligence; assistive technology; autism","artificial intelligence; assistive technology; autism; computer aided design; human; natural language processing; outcome assessment; Review; robotics; social interaction; surgical training","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autims Spectrum Disor Des Brisbane Au, (2021); undefined; Liu, Meijie, Autism Spectrum Disorder Studies Using fMRI Data and Machine Learning: A Review, Frontiers in Neuroscience, 15, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20754426","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183169193"

Taban is a novel social robot that has been designed and programmed specifically for educational interaction with dyslexic children, who have various problems in reading despite their normal intelligence. In this paper, the acceptability and eligibility of a virtual reality serious game with the presence of the Taban social robot avatar was studied among nineteen children six of whom were dyslexic. In this game, children perform attractive practical exercises while interacting with the Taban avatar in a virtual environment to strengthen their reading skills; then the game automatically evaluates their performance and the avatar gives them appropriate feedback. The sense of immersion in the 3D virtual space and the presence of the Taban robot avatar motivates the children to do the assignments. The results of the psychological assessment using the SAM questionnaire are promising and illustrate that the game was highly accepted by both groups of children.

In this paper we propose the combination of Music Therapy (MT) with cognitive training games administered by a humanoid robot (QT robot of LUXAI). This intervention is intended to mitigate cognitive decline in individuals with mild cognition impairment, while reducing the load on therapists and care staff, by offering MT to a larger population. The four implemented music-themed cognitive games elicit activation of different sets of cognitive functions, producing an overall multi-domain treatment, and adapt to subject’s preferences, skills and progress.

Dyslexic children usually have difficulty in reading and as a result, they face different educational problems at school. Currently, social robots are widely used as educational assistants and tutors, mainly for children with special needs. The Taban robot is a modern educational social robot, which was developed specifically for dyslexic children. In this paper, an android application was designed and developed to facilitate child-robot interaction just by means of a tablet. Using this smart tablet game, the children could collaborate with the Taban social robot in solving the pedagogic problems and practicing educational concepts, while the robot provides them not only beneficial verbal and physical reactions by its hands, but also effective visual feedback on its touch screen. For the first step in this research, the acceptability of the designed tablet game was investigated for twenty-one participants that fifth of them had dyslexia. The hopeful results of the SAM questionnaires filled out by the children, demonstrate high acceptability of the tablet game. Furthermore, by implementing automatic assessment based on the designed standard criteria, the platform could meaningfully distinguish the two groups of children (dyslexic and typically developed (TD)) according to their achieved scores in the game. Thus, the high potential value of the designed robot-aided tablet game was illustrated to be used as an assistive tool for dyslexic children. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Android programming; Educational technology; Human-robot interaction; Learning disabilities; Serious Games; Special Education","Educational robots; Robot programming; Serious games; Touch screens; Visual communication; Visual servoing; Android applications; Android programming; Child-robot interactions; Educational problems; Humans-robot interactions; Learning disabilities; Social robots; Special education; Special needs; Visual feedback; Human robot interaction","","","Vahia, Vihang N., Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5: A quick glance, Indian Journal of Psychiatry, 55, 3, pp. 220-223, (2013); Taheri, Alireza R., Impacts of using a social robot to teach music to children with low-functioning autism, Paladyn, 12, 1, pp. 256-275, (2021); Ghorbandaei Pour, Ali, Human–Robot Facial Expression Reciprocal Interaction Platform: Case Studies on Children with Autism, International Journal of Social Robotics, 10, 2, pp. 179-198, (2018); Educ Inf Technol, (2021); Tavakol Elahi, Maryam, “Xylotism”: A Tablet-Based Application to Teach Music to Children with Autism, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 10652 LNAI, pp. 728-738, (2017); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2015); Martins, Valéria Farinazzo, Mobile application to support dyslexia diagnostic and reading practice, Proceedings of IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA, 0, (2016); Vasalou, Asimina, Digital games-based learning for children with dyslexia: A social constructivist perspective on engagement and learning during group game-play, Computers and Education, 114, pp. 175-192, (2017); Borhan, Noor Hazlini, An enhancement of dyslexic mobile application using sight word reading strategy: Results and findings, Journal of Computer Science, 14, 7, pp. 919-929, (2018); Zare, Mahbobe, The role of Persian-language word exercise games in improving spelling of students with dyslexia: Word exercise games in improving spelling, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 36, 3, pp. 315-322, (2020)","Ali, A.A.; Cabibihan, J.-J.; Meskin, N.; Rossi, S.; Jiang, W.; He, H.; Ge, S.S.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","15th International Conference on Social Robotics, ICSR 2023","","Doha","305729","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180621700"

The investigation identifies 1,830 academic articles, of which 315 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review. Systematic reviews across various fields are reported, including mental disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, dementia/cognitive impairment, other medical conditions, elderly support, health promotion, mental health, education, industrial applications, agent characteristics, and robot characteristics. The study highlights challenges in current CA research, such as the scarcity of high-quality comparative studies and the acceptance of CAs by users and caregivers, particularly in elderly support. The article also categorises ethical discussions into nine elements: privacy, safety, innovation, user acceptance, psychological attachment, care philosophy, evaluation, social systems compatibility, and rule development. It also offers insights into the development of future guidelines. The role of CAs in fostering human relationships through their conversational function is emphasised to provide guidance for subsequent CA research and social implementation.

An obstacle is the heterogeneity of developmental pathways causing clinical phenotypes. Additionally, in symptom formations, the primary causes and consequences of developmental learning processes are often indistinguishable. Herein, we review developmental neurorobotic experiments tackling problems related to the dynamic and complex properties of neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, we focus on neurorobotic models under predictive processing lens for the study of developmental disorders. By constructing neurorobotic models with predictive processing mechanisms of learning, perception, and action, we can simulate formations of integrated causal relationships among neurodynamical, computational, and behavioral characteristics in the robot agents while considering developmental learning processes. This framework has the potential to bind neurobiological hypotheses (excitation-inhibition imbalance and functional disconnection), computational accounts (unusual encoding of uncertainty), and clinical symptoms.

The videos highlight research conducted at one UK and two US universities and showcase using social robots to diagnose and treat autistic children. The paper begins by contextualizing how a problematic model of autism informs calls for intervention as well as representations of autism in the videos themselves. Taking a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis Approach, the paper then describes three interrelated processes at work in the university videos: commodification, technologization and codification. Together, these concepts encapsulate the way in which the videos work as both institutional self-promotion and promotion of a particular perspective on communication. Informed by Ledin and Machin’s affordance-based approach in which choices in semiotic materials are first described and then analyzed as multimodal articulations, the video analysis attends to the use of narrative stages, scenes and settings, characters, rhythm and sound, and language and evaluations. What the analysis demonstrates is how the videos are both exercises in university commodification and responses to crisis autism and that this is done so as to make them seem complimentary projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","commodification; Critical autism studies; higher education; multimodality; promotional discourse; technologization of discourse","","","","Ball, Stephen John, Performativity, Commodification and Commitment: An I-Spy Guide to the Neoliberal University, British Journal of Educational Studies, 60, 1, pp. 17-28, (2012); Autism and the Myth of the Person Alone, (2005); Good to Talk Living and Working in A Communication Culture, (2000); undefined, (2010); Elmadagli, Cansu, The gains and losses of identity politics: the case of a social media social justice movement called stylelikeU, Critical Discourse Studies, 20, 4, pp. 415-435, (2023); Discourse and Social Change, (1992); Fairclough, Norman L., Critical discourse analysis and the marketization of public discourse: The universities, Discourse and Society, 4, 2, pp. 133-168, (1993); Critical Discourse Analysis the Critical Study of Language, (1995); Fairclough, Norman L., Critical discourse analysis, pp. 9-20, (2013); Wounded Storyteller Body Illness and Ethics, (1995)","","Routledge","","","","","","10350330; 14701219","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154534864"

Robotic interventions are among these. However, although robotics is frequently used with individuals with ASD, there is a limited number of reviews on social skills instruction and methods. The present study aimed to conduct a comprehensive descriptive analysis on single-case experimental designs where social skills were instructed to individuals with ASD and social robots were included as independent variables. Materials and methods: Thirteen single-case experimental designs published in peer-reviewed journals in which social skills were taught to individuals with ASD using social robots were reviewed with a comprehensive descriptive analysis based on five categories: (a) key characteristics, (b) methodological characteristics, (c) findings, (d) data analysis, and (e) key parameters in single-case experimental designs. Results: Social robots are generally effective in the instruction of social skills. Several social skills (e.g., making eye contact, social interaction, simple greetings) were instructed in the studies. Humanoid robots and NAO were used generally. The study data were predominantly analyzed statistically. There were several problems in research based on the basic parameters in single-case experimental designs. Conclusions: The researches in this study differ in several respects (e.g., results, data analysis, and dependent variable). Thus, there is still a need for several robotics studies in the instruction of social skills. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION This study will be a guide for teachers who currently use robots in their classrooms but do not know which skills to use in teaching and how to use them functionally, as it shows applied research with robots. The findings of this research will show implementers working with children with ASD that technological tools can be used in rehabilitation environments, and that teachers can take a place in their robots in interventions for children with ASD, giving them a different perspective. It will be seen that the education of children with ASD is not only 1:1 and with humans, but robots can also provide education. In this way, the power of technology in teaching will become clearer. Especially in rehabilitation. Finally, this research will offer new options in teaching especially for teachers who aim at teaching social skills and will give them the opportunity to comprehensively examine the processes of different studies on these subjects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","autism spectrum disorders; human-robot interaction; Robot; social robots; social skills","autism; child; human; methodology; procedures; robotics; social competence; social interaction; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Humans; Research Design; Robotics; Social Interaction; Social Skills","","","Text Revision Dsm IV TR, (1994); Teaching Social Skills to Children, (1986); School Psychology Review, (1984); Matson, Johnny L., A critical review of assessment targets and methods for social skills excesses and deficits for children with autism spectrum disorders, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 1, 1, pp. 28-37, (2007); Social Skills for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2012); Grossard, Charline, Serious games to teach social interactions and emotions to individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Computers and Education, 113, pp. 195-211, (2017); Educational Research and Reviews, (2006); Radley, Keith C., The feasibility and effects of a parent-facilitated social skills training program on social engagement of children with autism spectrum disorders, Psychology in the Schools, 51, 3, pp. 241-255, (2014); Use of Behavior Skills Training to Teach Paraprofessionals Discrete Trial Teaching, (2016); Ramdoss, Sathiyaprakash T., Use of Computer-Based Interventions to Teach Communication Skills to Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review, Journal of Behavioral Education, 20, 1, pp. 55-76, (2011)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","17483107; 17483115","","","35758001","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132914981"

Additionally, they might require distinct methods for moving, learning, or focusing. Many children with ASD are intelligent enough to be average or above average, yet autism can still affect their lives and lead to disabilities in learning. Some of these learning difficulties can be effectively addressed with early interventions. For those with autism, personalized learning programs can be put in place to address learning deficits and ensure success. This paper surveys smart tools and techniques reached in the research to assist autistic patients in learning, analyzes their effectiveness, and highlights their strengths and limitations. The survey shows that many of the proposed solutions utilize robots, augmented reality, and mobile apps derived by machine learning to assist autistic children in developing communication skills and expressing their emotions more effectively. However, most systems were managed by parents who were not good observers or by therapists with less experience. This encourages certain researchers to offer observational support to increase the efficacy of ASD interventions. This paper also reviews a guideline to build an autonomous system for learning autistics that can observe the activities of the learner and provide feedback to adapt the system accordingly. Finally, an intelligent platform is proposed to assist autistic patients in learning or entertainment according to their pace and conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Autism Learning; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Deep-Fake; Humanoid Robots; Machine Learning; Mobile Application; Object Recognition; Robots; Unity","Deep learning; Intelligent robots; Mobile robots; Robot learning; Supervised learning; Autism learning; Autism spectrum disorders; Children with autisms; Deep-fake; Humanoid robot; Machine-learning; Mobile applications; Objects recognition; Tools and techniques; Unity; Anthropomorphic robots","","","Autism Spectrum Disorders, (2010); Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder, (2024); Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder Abilities and Challenges; Journal of Autism Research, (2024); Journal of Developmental Disabilities, (2024); Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, (2024); Current Psychiatry Reports, (2024); Tsuchiya, Kenji J., Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder Without Expertise: A Pilot Study of 5- to 17-Year-Old Individuals Using Gazefinder, Frontiers in Neurology, 11, (2021); undefined, (2021); A Parent S Guide to Applied Behavior Analysis for Autism Spectrum Disorder Future Horizons, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","34th International Conference on Computer Theory and Applications, ICCTA 2024","","Alexandria","208540","","9798331529673","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004879732"

These are related to unfavorable health behaviors like disturbed sleeping patterns, poor diet, poverty, unemployment, some unusual life events, and higher addiction rates. Of late, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders are ruling the world and have become more prominent among the youth belonging to high-income nations. Depression is the most common disease in clinical practice, leading to occupational, social, interpersonal, and financial problems. However, Machine learning (ML) is becoming the main cause of the Big Data insurgence. It has captured applications in diverse domains, for instance, industries, pharmacy, medicinal chemistry, waste treatment plants, social networking, management, robotics, digital advertisements, physiological signal monitoring, electronic health record (EHR), medical & pathological imaging, and smart sensors. These techniques are computer-based equipped on automation, development, adaptation, prediction, and interpretation of the result by the machine. In this context, this review pertains the recent literature information about the real time prediction of various types of mental disorders using machine learning approach. Adaboost predicted depression with 92.5 % accuracy and 93.6 % specificity. Moreover, XGBoost was applied for post stroke depression. Otherwise RNN could be utilized depression from EEG brain wave data. While SVM was explored for androgenic alopecia, However, RF model was evaluated for anxiety. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Diagnosis; Feature Selection; Machine Learning; Mental disorders; SMOTE","Adaptive boosting; Effluent treatment; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Electronic health record; Electronic Waste; Electrotherapeutics; Endocrinology; Medical robotics; Medicinal chemistry; mHealth; Occupational diseases; Bipolar disorder; Comparatives studies; Features selection; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Mental disorders; Obsessive-compulsive disorders; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Psychiatric disease; SMOTE; Records management","","","Yatham, Swetha S., Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among youth in low and middle income countries: A review of prevalence and treatment interventions, Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 38, pp. 78-91, (2018); Hueniken, Katrina, Machine learning-based predictive modeling of anxiety and depressive symptoms during 8 months of the covid-19 global pandemic: Repeated cross-sectional survey study, JMIR Mental Health, 8, 11, (2021); Nemesure, Matthew D., Predictive modeling of depression and anxiety using electronic health records and a novel machine learning approach with artificial intelligence, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Uddin, Md Zia, Deep learning for prediction of depressive symptoms in a large textual dataset, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 1, pp. 721-744, (2022); Nguyen, Hung Viet, Explainable Deep-Learning-Based Depression Modeling of Elderly Community after COVID-19 Pandemic, Mathematics, 10, 23, (2022); Zulfiker, Md Sabab, An in-depth analysis of machine learning approaches to predict depression, Current Research in Behavioral Sciences, 2, (2021); Sarkar, Avik, A deep learning-based comparative study to track mental depression from EEG data, Neuroscience Informatics, 2, 4, (2022); Journal of Basic Science and Engineering, (2024); Aderka, Idan M., Using machine-learning to predict sudden gains in treatment for major depressive disorder, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 144, (2021); Chiong, Raymond, A textual-based featuring approach for depression detection using machine learning classifiers and social media texts, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 135, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on Advances in Computation, Communication and Information Technology, ICAICCIT 2024","","Faridabad","207611","","9798331541217","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001327354"

This work presents a Bibliometric Review that aims to characterize the current scenario of academic research in Artificial Intelligence in education to support educators in the teaching and learning processes in Special Education in different contexts, becoming a tool with potential use in cases of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this sense, this work aims to contribute to a better understanding of research associated with the area of Artificial Intelligence aimed at educational processes involving students with autism. To do this, we used the EndNote reference manager, an online tool designed to support researchers in conducting Literature Reviews, following the bibliometric protocol proposed by Guedes and Borschiver (2005). From the definition of search strings, ('artificial intelligence') AND ('autism' OR 'ASD' OR 'autism spectrum disorder') AND ('education' OR 'teaching'), scientific databases were explored like Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, ERIC, Emerald, Scielo, Portal CAPES, and IEEE, to locate existing studies on the topic, between 2019 and 2024. As a result, 298 articles were mapped and 20 scientific works were selected that address the aforementioned specific theme, written by 89 authors belonging to 50 institutions in 19 countries on four continents, enabling the creation of a significant theoretical basis. By analyzing the information contained in scientific publications in this specific field, it was possible to infer that research is divided into distinct areas of concentration: 1) the exploration of algorithms and data analysis based on Artificial Intelligence for analytical-predictive issues in the field of special education; 2) the use of robots in the teaching and learning processes of students with autism; 3) the development of personalized educational intervention models for learning pedagogical, social and communication skills. The data show that research on the use of Artificial Intelligence in the education of autistic people can still be explored, presenting itself as a promising area for future investigations. The present study facilitates understanding of the current state of knowledge in this area, by identifying gaps in areas that require investigation, thus promoting the development of further research.

This condition gives rise to many issues, including functional and cognitive impairments, disabilities, motor deficits, and gait disturbances. The recovery of motor functions related to walking is crucial for these patients. Gait rehabilitation in such cases necessitates repetitive exercises and long-term duration. Therefore, using assistive robots in gait training can address these needs and alleviate the burden on therapists. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the impact of utilizing the exoskeleton Assistive Robot of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, FUMHEXA, on the movement parameters in hemiplegic stroke patients. In this study, 12 hemiplegic stroke patients underwent a 12-session treatment regimen with the FUM-HEXA robot. This study introduced four laboratory indicators of walking endurance, symmetry, cadence, and stride time, which are calculated using movement sensors to evaluate patients' health. The results indicate improvements in walking endurance, increased gait symmetry with the robot-assisted therapy, increased cadence, and decreased stride time. Considering the challenges and time-intensive nature of gait rehabilitation, along with the substantial pressure on therapists, the FUM-HEXA robot seems to serve as a helpful rehabilitation tool alongside other therapeutic modalities. This is achieved by providing targeted and repetitive walking exercises and relieving both the psychological and physical stress from physiotherapist during gait rehabilitation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gait; Hemiplegia; Rehabilitation; Robotics; Stroke; Wearable Exoskeleton","Arthroplasty; Electrotherapeutics; Gait analysis; Medical robotics; Neurology; Robotic arms; Walking aids; Assistive robots; Clinical trial; Gait; Gait rehabilitation; Gait symmetries; Hemiplegia; Neurological disorders; Stroke; Stroke patients; Wearable exoskeleton; Exoskeleton (Robotics)","","","Coupland, Alexander P., The definition of stroke, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 110, 1, pp. 9-12, (2017); Tsao, Connie W., Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2022 Update: A Report from the American Heart Association, Circulation, 145, 8, pp. E153-E639, (2022); Thaut, Michael H., Rhythmic facilitation of gait training in hemiparetic stroke rehabilitation, Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 151, 2, pp. 207-212, (1997); Recovery of Walking Function in Stroke; Trompetto, Carlo, Postactivation depression changes after robotic-assisted gait training in hemiplegic stroke patients, Gait and Posture, 38, 4, pp. 729-733, (2013); Kramer, Sharon Flora, The Impact of Physical Activity Before and After Stroke on Stroke Risk and Recovery: a Narrative Review, Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports, 19, 6, (2019); Chen, Bing, A wearable exoskeleton suit for motion assistance to paralysed patients, Journal of Orthopaedic Translation, 11, pp. 7-18, (2017); Molteni, F.
