Eduardo? “ Department of Energy and Mechanical Sciences, Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolqui, 170501, Ecuador ’School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali, 76001, Valle del Cauca, Colombia Corresponding author: ‘johanna.tobar@correounivalle.edu.co Abstract— This work presents the design and construction of a recreational platform named KERO, which is oriented to the development of non-verbal communication skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) levels 1 and 2, between ages of 4 and 7 years old. The development of a friendly-looking robot with head and upper limbs movement is presented, which can perform 8 gestures such as: Cry, happy, Affirm, Deny, Say Hello, Exclaim, Quiet, Aim. KERO is a social robot that interacts with children with ASD through the usage of an intuitive interface. This interface allows proper interaction with the robot. In this interface, two games were developed to complement the robot-children interaction and increase their cognitive abilities by observing improvements in his/her attention, perception, memory, and problem-solving. The tests were validated under two different scenarios, preliminary and field tests, involving psychopedagogues, initial education students, therapists and children with ASD. Tests were carried out in a different number of sessions for each child. Each patient with ASD showed a different degree of social interaction with the KERO playable kit; their therapists evaluated this interaction during all sessions. At the end of the sessions with the patients, an improvement of 45% in recognition of gestures and 23.06% in the execution time of the memory game could be observed.

According to Zusuki et al. [2], Children with ASD need an The work of Scassellati et al. [7] improves the social skills of entertainment environment to get longer interaction with them. a group of children, using an autonomous robot interacting They used NAO dancing that could help in the learning of with them for about 30 minutes in a one-month period, social skills. On the other hand, Alarfaj et al. [3] indicate that showing that robots can provoke proactive social behavior in robotic technology can be useful to overcome disabilities in children with ASD. Esteban et al. [8] propose a supervised ASD therapy. Several studies have proved of great help to autonomous system using robots to apply in the therapy of some children; however, there are no treatments that children with ASD. Also, it is mentioned that some ethical completely improve the symptoms or work for all children considerations have to be considered in the acceptance of with ASD [4]. Van Straten et al. [5] discuss that not all robots robots in therapies for children with ASD, mentioning that a can help treat children with ASD; the study shows that a fully autonomous robot may not be good for these therapies. robot’s intonation and bodily appearance are essential A study conducted by Petric et al. [9] developed a robot- 1295 assisted ASD diagnostic protocol. This is important because, in the future, the robot could track a child and observe its behavior in a more efficient way than a therapist. The development of social and communication skills 1s generated in the first years of life. So, it 1s important to stimulate this type of skill from an early age. In a study carried by Ali et al. [10], an adaptive multi-robot therapy was implemented in 12 ASD children improving imitation skills and joint attention, helping to improve their social communications. In a case study conducted by Huijnen ef al., they used the KASPAR robot to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of using robots to interact with children with ASD. The study consisted of an interaction between the robot and a group of children through 6 different roles, based on each child's needs and the recommendation of the therapists. During the sessions, it was observed how the children react to each role shown by the robot. At the end of the investigation, it was concluded that the use of the KASPAR robot would have positive expectations in achieving specific goals in the treatment of children with Autism [11]. In many cases, therapies for ASD are time-consuming. Therefore, it 1s necessary to develop new evaluation methods such as the partially observable Markov decision process modeling (POMDP), which uses a robot to give an ASD diagnostic protocol. This type of process is useful in situations of uncertainty, as indicated by Petric et al. [12]. However, in other cases, conventional treatments provided by therapists are important because they have direct observation of behaviors of children with ASD. The advice of professionals in this area is important during the application of robots for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder. [13], [14]. Damianidou et al. [15] study the role of social robots like Probo models in assisting therapies with autistic children. This study indicates that Probo can recognize emotions in children and also show their own emotions. The tests indicate that using this type of robot can be effective in improving social skills in people with ASD. A study carried out by Vlachou et al. [16] evaluates the effect of applying mobile technology in treatments of people with autism spectrum disorder and points out that there is great potential to develop autonomous mobile robots focused on young people with autism. These systems provide interactive environments and can offer a better life quality. Silvera-Tawil et al. [17] conducted a study on students with intellectual disabilities and autism after interacting with two humanoid robots. During this time, the students improved communication skills and helped improve the interaction of autism patients with their environment. The proposed project is of great importance because it serves as a support tool for developing non-verbal communication skills of children with ASD. It consists of a robot that has memory games and a gesture identification game. The playful kit allows children to interact with technology and software; it contributes to the validation of knowledge acquired by the child through the therapies performed, providing a versatile device that can be used in both treatment centers for children with ASD and in every child's home. 1296 Il. MATERIAL AND METHOD This section presents the different technical and social characteristics that were considered for the development of the "KERO" gaming platform, and the functionality of the robot is detailed. A. Therapeutic and technical requirements KERO is a robot kit designed to help to improve the learning of non-verbal communication skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), aged between 4 to 7 years. The requirements and suggestions provided by therapists from the CERENI Neuropsychological Rehabilitation Center are listed below: To avoid screws or surfaces that could hurt the child. e To paint the robot with light colours or pastels. Do not place more than 6 pairs of cards in the memory game. To activate sounds for each successful task. To place images of characters with whom the child is attracted (superheroes, animals, etc.) To develop in the native language of the children of the target population (Spanish). In addition, other considerations must consider improving the effectiveness of the tool; among them, we have: the robot must be reprogrammable, robust, affordable, and must offer options in its games [18]. A Gaming Platform was made with a white human-like robot to meet these specifications, with 8 degrees of freedom, 2 for head movement, and 6 for upper limb movements. Finally, KERO has two games that allow it to interact with children with ASD: one consisting of a memory game to choose pairs of cards and a second game to improve visual attention, where the child must recognize the gesture made by the robot. B. KERO design This section describes the design and operation of the Playable Kit KERO and the reasons why each element of the system was implemented. 1) External Appearance: A robot capable of human-like movements and a child-friendly appearance was designed. This was considered because, as Mori [20] stated, there is a relationship between human similarity and the familiarity, sympathy, or comfort felt in the presence of an individual or object, in this case, the KERO robot in Fig. 1). uncanny valley, Pete “4 \ ’ ‘ bunraku puppet ' humanoid robot s ’ ? ’ , bd . + healthy person - ¢ - * = . -” stuffed animal - . . - industrial robot, - + comfort level (shinwakan) 50% 100% prosthetic hand human likeness = comse—~ ! 1/ ' s ‘ ' s zombie —*" Fig. 1 Graphic of the uncanny valley [19] In Fig. 1, Mori describes that this comfort remains stable until a point is reached where robots tend to appear so close to humans that even the smallest imperfections can make them look unsettling. This feature is called the Uncanny Valley. Due to this uncanny valley, it was decided to make a robot like a human, taking care of aspects that prevent the robot from causing fear or confusion in children with autism. 2) Materials and Components: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) was used to make the robot structure. The material is chosen to make the robot polylactic acid (PLA) because it is not a toxic material and is friendly to the environment as it is biodegradable. The PLA has a consistent structure, easy to use, and gives a smoother and brighter appearance to the robot, obtaining more detail. In addition, it was evaluated that the mechanical properties of PLA (Table 1) allow the robot to be more robust. TABLE I MECHANICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLA [21 | Property Dimension Elastic modulus 3500 [MPa] Density 1.25 [g/cm’3 | Young’s modulus 1280[MPa] Tensile strength 59 [MPa] Elongation at break 7% Specific heat (55 ° C) 1590 [J/kg- ° C] Melt density 1.07 [g/cm43 | Ultimate tensile strength 73 [MPa] Thermal conductivity (48 ° C) 0.11 [W/m- ° K] To build the base and the wireless controller of the robot, 4mm thick Acrylic / PMMA was used because it is a resistant, light and easy to transport material. Laser cutting was used to manufacture each support and sides of the base. This tool was used due to its high precision, it also allows for round finishes, and it does not require any further processing. The Kero Playable kit will have a set of components that will allow the robot to interact in an optimal way, depending on the therapy and the child's preferences. In this way, the KERO Playable Kit will be made up of several components, as shown in Fig. 2, and they are listed below: KERO robot (Fig. 2A). Robot base (Fig. 2B). Box for transporting the robot (Fig 2C). Clay set (Fig 2D). Wireless controller (Fig 2E) (A) Fig. 2 Components of the Playful Kit 1297 An important feature of the KERO playable kit is the possibility of replacing the buttons on the wireless controller for the robot with buttons that children can create with everyday items such as play Doh clay, leaves or petals. The robot base (Fig. 3) is adapted to place the direction arrow buttons and a selection button. Fig. 3 Using modeling clay as an input peripheral. 3) Gestures and Movements: The robot will be able to perform 8 different gestures through movements of both the head and movements of the upper extremities. Each movement is carried out in a uniform way, avoiding rough or sudden actions that disturb the child. Next, each gesture is explained with the respective movement made by the robot, as in Fig. 4. Roy 1 era / bal Fig. 4 Gestures made by the robot These gestures are described as follows: e Crying: In this gesture, the robot raises the upper right limb towards the head, the head moves slightly downwards and the arm moves back and forth while a sad face with tears in the eyes appears on the screen (Fig. 4A). Scared: The robot raises its 2 limbs towards the head, and the screen shows a scared gesture with its mouth open (Fig. 4B). No: The robot moves its head from one side to the other several times, and the screen shows a neutral gesture. (Fig. 4C). e Yes: The robot moves its head back and forth several times, and the screen shows a neutral gesture (Fig. 4D). e Cheerful: The robot raises both upper limbs above the head, shaking slightly to the sides. The screen shows an open-mouthed smile gesture (Fig. 4E). e Pointing: The robot raises its right upper limb to shoulder height and leaves it in a horizontal position for about 3 seconds. The display shows a neutral (Fig. 4F). e Calm: The robot raises the arms slightly above the waist for about 3 seconds. The screen shows a neutral gesture (Fig. 4G). e Greet: The robot raises its right upper limb above its head and moves from left to right several times. The screen shows a neutral gesture (Fig. 4H). C. Game Description The screen has an attractive and easy-to-use environment for children with ASD. Light colors and pastel tones were used since it is a requirement; following these aspects, two games were developed: 1) Pair of Cards Game: The first game consists of finding the pair of cards of the same figure from a set of cards. The game will have 2, 3, 4 and 6 pairs of cards (Fig. 5), depending on the memory capacity of each child with ASD. Fig. 5 Card pairs game interface. 2) Recognize the Robot's Gesture:The second game consists in that the child must identify the gesture made by the robot and select it on the screen (Fig. 6). In case the child fails, they have the option to try again, until the child get it right. LLORAR ASUSTADO NO SI Fig. 6 Gesture game interface. D. KERO Software GUI The KERO playable kit can be operated in 2 ways: the first will be through the use of a wireless controller, which will have 4 directional buttons to move the cursor and a selection button. The second will be with the use of everyday objects such as clay, which will replace the wireless controller for handling the robot. See Fig. 7. = Fig. 7 Playful Kit Once the robot has been turned on, the main menu will be displayed (Fig. 8). With the "A" button, the memory game is selected, with the "B" button the game of recognizing the gesture, and with the "C" button, the robot is switched off. Fig. 8 Starting screen With the “A” button, a screen is displayed where the type of memory cards must be selected (Fig. 9). You can choose between two types of cards: animated character cards (Button “D") and emotion cards (Button E). Once the type of card has been selected, a screen will open to choose the number of pairs of cards (Fig. 10). Subsequently, the memory game screen is displayed with the number of pairs selected (Fig. 11). With the "F" button, you can exit the game and go to the main menu. The memory game is over once all pairs of cards have been discovered. Animated QO Fig. 9 Card type selection screen Select the number of pairs Fig. 10 Card number selection screen } Fig. 11 Card game screen. Back to the main activity shown in Fig. 8, using the “B” button, the gesture identification set is selected. Once the "B" button has been pressed, the robot proceeds to perform one of the 8 programmed gestures. When the robot finishes making the movement, a screen is displayed where the child must select the gesture made by the robot (Fig. 12). If the child chooses the gesture wrongly, the game indicates the option to try again or exit to the main menu (Fig. 13). The game ends once the child has correctly identified the gesture made by the WRa'h Savas What movement did the robot make? Fig. 12 Gesture recognition game screen Do you want to try again? Fig. 13 Screen again attempt of the game to recognize gestures At the end of any of the two games, the robot proceeds to make a gesture of joy accompanied by motivating sounds as positive reinforcement for the child for having performed the task successfully. III]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION KERO was validated under two different scenarios: preliminary tests and field tests, each of which is described in this section. A. Preliminary Tests To validate the tool before testing it in the target population, preliminary tests were carried out on two groups of people described below: e Group A: 12 Psychopedagogues. e Group B: A group of 23 initial education students. The presentation of the operation of the KERO Playable Kit was made virtually due to the global health emergency and the confinement by Covid 19. Using multimedia tools, the characteristics and operation of the KERO Playable Kit were shown. A survey was conducted on each group of people; the questions are described in (Table 2).

Question | is based on the modified Likert scale [22]; the following notations are considered: Not at all attractive (N.A), Unattractive (U), Attractive (A) and Very Attractive (V.A). The results of group A and B surveys are shown in (Table 3), (Table 4) and (Table 5).

Also, when analyzing the answers to questions 6,7 and 9, 1t is concluded that the two groups of people think that the KERO robot can help develop memory, visual attention, and considering that the kit can make it possible a contribution to the education of gestures. In question 8, group A prefers the use of 6 pairs of cards to be implemented in the game for children between 4 and 7 years old, while group B presented two modes that are 4 and 6 pairs of cards for this game, obtaining a median of 5 pairs. In question 5, both groups A and B consider that the child will show interest in the KERO playable kit because 97% of the respondents answered yes. In question 2, both groups A and B consider that using the KERO playable kit helps improve the child's non-verbal communication skills because 97% of the respondents answered yes. B. Field Tests For the second scenario, a series of field tests were carried out with previously established experimental subjects; The operation of the KERO Playable Kit was presented and implemented in-person for children with ASD at the CERENI Neuropsychological Rehabilitation Center. A field test was carried out in Quito-Ecuador with the pediatric population diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, who regularly attend the Neuropsychological Rehabilitation Center- CERENI. CERENI is a rehabilitation center that provides diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of people with diseases of the nervous system, which can be acquired or developed, both in adults and children; thus, allowing them to access a complete and coordinated treatment in one place. Currently, the treatments performed by therapists at CERENI for children with ASD are traditional. I) Subjects: The subjects tested during the experiments belong to the CERENI pediatric population. The therapies were developed with four children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Therapists selected the children participating in the experiments from the rehabilitation center after obtaining informed consent from each child's parents or legal guardians. 2) Ethical Considerations: The experimental procedure was carried out according to the recommendations approved by the ethics committee of the Universidad del Valle, issued in the ap-proved document 003-020. 3) Experimentation: The experimentation process consisted of testing and using the robot by children with ASD in a period of approximately 1 month; the tests were carried out in different sessions, lasting approximately 30 minutes for each child. During the first sessions, work was done on familiarizing the child with the robot and with the researchers present in each test. The children were admitted together with their therapists to the testing room. Subsequently, a researcher oversaw the gesture recognition game for the child to observe the robot's movements and thus capture their attention (Fig. 14). Once the child became interested in the robot and tried to interact with it, he was told how the robot works and, in case the child allows more interaction; he was allowed to use the wireless controller and the clay-based controller (Fig. 15). Fig. 15 Field test 1 with an experiment subject using plasticine, carried out on July 30, 2020. In later sessions, the child could use the robot without any help, as they adapted to the operation and logic of each KERO game (Fig. 16). In this scenario, the effects of the robot to aid memory and visual attention of each child were observed.

The children showed an interest in certain elements of the robot (Figures 17- 20) that will be described based on the results of the surveys carried out. Fig. 21 shows the therapists who were present during the tests in children with ASD. Due to the current confinement situation, not all the children were able to attend their therapies on a regular basis, obtaining different number of sessions for each child, which are described below: With the first child, who has grade | ASD (Patient 1), 6 sessions were carried out, in which the gesture recognition game, the memory game were performed and also managed to imitate most of the gestures that the robot performed. In the case of the second child, who has grade 1 ASD (Patient 2), 6 sessions were carried out, in which the gesture recognition game and the memory game were performed. Finally, the children corresponding to Patient 3 and Patient 4 of grade 2 and 3, respectively, 4 sessions were carried out, in which the gesture recognition game and the memory game were performed. 4) Field Test Results: The degree of social interaction that each child with ASD showed with the use of the KERO playable kit was evaluated by their therapists during all sessions. The evaluations were carried out with the use of a survey, detailed in Table 6.

Based on the responses to each survey, graphs were obtained to evaluate the impact of the KERO playable kit on each child with ASD. In questions | to 8, the number of correct answers in 5 attempts is evaluated when identifying a certain gesture. To analyze the results of these questions, linear graphs of each gesture were made where the number of correct answers is detailed according to the session that the children performed (Figures 22- 29). In Fig. 22, it 1s observed that from session 3 there is a general improvement in the perception of the YES gesture. Patients 1 and 2 managed to get 5 out of 5 attempts right at the end of the 6 sessions, while patients 3 and 4 managed to obtain 3 correct answers at the end of the 4 sessions. 1302 Gesture Yes 6 ad £5 o 4 = D3 S> ® 2 £ 1 = z 0 0 1 2 & 4 5 6 7 Session Number —®—Patient4 -—@—Patient3 -®-—Patient1 —®—Patient 2 Fig. 22 Results Question | In Fig. 23, it is observed that from session 2 there 1s a general improvement in the perception of the NO gesture.

It is also recommended to increase the screen size so that patients are able to see the images clearly in each of the games. Finally, it is recommended to personalize each game according to the needs of each child with the help of the therapists, either by implementing different images or different gestures to seek to improve specific problems in each patient. IV. CONCLUSION KERO 1s a Playable kit with two games to develop memory and gesture recognition, designed and implemented as a support tool in the development of non-verbal communication skills of children with ASD in ages 4 to 7 years. The tool was validated in preliminary tests and field tests, which indicate that children adapt more easily to a wireless controller because they are familiar with smartphones and similar devices. The presentation of an alternative means of handling the robot, such as modeling clay, did not positively impact the therapies since it became a distraction that prevented the child from interacting with the robot and meeting the session's objectives. Once the sessions with the target population have been completed. It can be concluded that the KERO Playable KIT contributes, during therapy, to the interaction between the therapist and the child. Since it 1s not invasive, it allows creating an environment of curiosity and trust with the therapist. In addition, an improvement was observed in the recognition of gestures by children with autism, with the exception of the calm gesture, which is recommended to change to another one or modify it to make it easier to recognize. The child who showed the greatest progress during the sessions was patient 2, who, after performing six sessions, managed to imitate most of the gestures and exclamations made by the robot through the movement of his body. As an analysis of the results, it can be concluded that there is an average improvement of 23.06%. The decrease in the amount of time to execute the memory games because they adapted to the game's dynamics and controlled the robot more easily and with confidence throughout the sessions. It could also be concluded that the children improved their ability to 1304 recognize gestures. Based on the evaluations carried out during the sessions, an average improvement percentage of 45% was obtained. The results obtained in each session depend on certain factors such as the predisposition that each child has to work and the constancy with which they attended the therapies, for which in some sessions there are setbacks in the results of each child.
