Imitation, focus of attention and social behaviours of children with autism spectrum disorder in interaction with robots Sanja Simlea} Jasmina Sto8i¢} Irena BiliC? and Maja Cepanec’ ‘ University of Zagreb * University Hospital of Split Many studies have shown that using robot platforms can be effective for teaching children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of this study was to compare performance on an imitation task, as well as focus attention levels and the presence of social behaviours of children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children during an imitation task under two different conditions, with robots and human demonstrators. The results suggested that TD children did not imitate more than children with ASD. Children with ASD did not imitate the robot more than they imitated a person, but they showed more focused attention to robots and expressed more social behaviours in interaction with the robots. Behaviours that were significantly more present in ASD children than in TD children included touching the robot in the robot demonstrator condition and focusing on the robot in the person demonstrator condition. This implies a possible preference of children with ASD towards robots rather than towards people. Keywords: imitation, autism spectrum disorder, humanoid robot Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction, accompanied by the pres- ence of stereotyped behaviours, restricted interests, cognitive inflexibility and/ or sensory sensitivities (American Psychiatric Association, 2014). Children with ASD face various developmental challenges that affect their everyday living. Some studies suggest that imitation skills represent one of the core problems in ASD (Rogers & Pennington, 1991; Williams et al., 2004) due to the interrelationship of imitation with the development of cognitive and social skills. https://doi.org/10.1075/is.21037.sim Interaction Studies 23:1 (2022), pp. 1-20.

There are two roles of imitation in the child’s development: learning new skills and engaging in socio - emotional exchanges with people in their environment (Uzgiris, 1981). Barr and Hayne (2003) found that 12- to 18-month-old children master one to two new behaviours per day through imi- tation. Numerous studies (e.g., Charman et al., 2000; Ingersoll & Schreibman, 2006; Poon et al., 2012; Toth et al., 2006) have indicated that imitation, along with joint attention and play, affects the language and communication development of typically developing (TD) children and children with ASD. Imitation skills seem to be connected to early forms of understanding of mental states of others. Dur- ing imitation of facial expressions, children must combine their perception of the behaviour of others with their own senses and motor coordination in the specific moment. This affects the emotional connection between the child and the parent (McEwen et al., 2007). In many aspects of imitation, children with ASD are different than their typi- cal peers. They have more difficulty with spontaneous imitation than they do with induced imitation (Ingersoll, 2008). They present a lower frequency of imitation of actions with objects and gestures (Wild et al., 2012), although they perform bet- ter in imitation of actions with objects than in imitation of gestures (Ingersoll & Meyer, 2011). They also have more difficulty imitating senseless actions (Ingersoll & Meyer, 2011) and complex activities (Vivanti & Hamilton, 2014). Therefore, imitation training is one of the key areas in interventions for chil- dren with ASD. Behavioural interventions have been shown to be effective in teaching imitation to children with ASD (Hwang & Hughes, 2000; Ingersoll & Gergans, 2007; Ingersoll et al., 2007). Social assistive robotics in children with ASD Advances in technology, offer greater possibilities of using robots in ASD inter- ventions (Chung, 2021). Humanoid robots can provide social cues, such as those produced by humans in interaction and communication, like eye contact, head movements, gestures, and a human-like voice. Using robots can overcome various barriers that arise from face-to-face interaction for children with ASD (Huijnen et al., 2017). Children with ASD show a higher preference for robots compared to humans (Bird et al., 2007; Chaminade et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013; Scassellati et al., 2012). Feil-Seifer and Mataric (2005, 2009) define social assistive robotics Imitation and social behaviours in interaction with robots 3 as using social robots for the purpose of providing support to users by making their social interaction easier. In children with ASD, robots represent an inter- active device with important social characteristics that enable teaching, motiva- tion, and changes in behaviour (Scassellati et al., 2012). Robots are being used in clinical and research settings with increased frequency (Duquette et al., 2008) because their simple, inanimate, and predictable characteristics are useful for children with ASD. They also provide the unique opportunity for the quantifica- tion of social behaviours, since they are designed to detect, measure and respond to social behaviours (Tapus et al., 2007). Chevalier et al. (2020) emphasized the role of robots in studying joint attention and social conditions. Robots can pro- vide a high degree of experimental control with relatively high ecological validity. They offer a repeatable, objective, and quantitative assessment of social response, which minimizes the personal biases of evaluators. Robots were used in ASD intervention to target skills in different domains, such as communication, social/interpersonal interactions and relations, play, emotional wellbeing, sensory experiences and coping, motor experiences and skills, recognition of basic emotions, preschool skills, and functioning in daily life (Bartl-Pokorny et al., 2021; Huijnen et al., 2016; Jouaiti & Hénaff, 2019; Pennisi et al., 2016). Robot use for imitation learning and elicitation of social behaviours in children with ASD Existing studies (for example, Bird et al., 2007; Duquette et al., 2008; Peca et al., 2015; Pierno et al., 2008; Pioggia et al., 2008; Taheri et al., 2020; Tapus et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2016) suggest that using social robots can be effective in teaching imi- tation skills to children with ASD. In most of the available studies, children with ASD show a preference towards robots. Furthermore, in some studies, children imitate robots more than humans (Bird et al., 2007; Pierno et al., 2008; Pioggia et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2016), while in others, they imitate human demonstra- tors more (Costa et al., 2018; Duquette et al., 2008; Taheri et al., 2020). Beyond imitation, robots can elicit various social behaviours of children with ASD (Aryania et al., 2021), specifically joint attention (Anzalone et al., 2014; Duquette et al., 2008), social engagement (Scassellati et al., 2012), verbalization (Kim et al., 2013), eye contact (Simut et al., 2016) and prosocial behaviours (Kim etal., 2021). Some studies have found that robots are better than humans in eliciting joint attention (Duquette et al., 2008), communication (Vanderborght et al., 2012), and imitation (Pierno et al., 2008). Other studies have found that robots are similar to humans in eliciting communication (Huskens et al., 2015) 4 Sanja SimleSa, Jasmina Sto8i¢, Irena Bili¢, and Maja Cepanec and joint attention (Tapus et al., 2012). There are also studies that have shown that a robot was less successful than a person at eliciting imitation of body movements (Duquette et al., 2008) and joint attention (Anzalone et al., 2014). It is important to note that the small sample size in many of these studies does not allow for the generalization of the results. Moreover, different robot platforms were used (FACE robot, NAO robot), which is problematic given children’s pref- erence for different morphological forms (Scassellati et al., 2012). Finally, children with ASD are a very heterogeneous population that should be considered in mak- ing conclusions about the whole population. The results of previous studies on the role of the robot in intervention and diagnostic processes and differences between TD children and children with ASD in interaction with robots are still inconclusive. The results regarding whether robots can be, at least as effective as people, to teach abilities to children with ASD and to elicit social behaviours are also mixed. The aim of this study is to compare performance on imitation tasks and the occurrence of accompanied social behaviours of children with ASD and TD chil- dren under two different conditions, with robots versus human (person) demon- strators. Instead of pure motoric imitation, an imitation task involving real objects in the environment was proposed, as well as a task that also includes joint atten- tion skills. Methods Participants The participants were 24 preschool children divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 12 children (4 girls, 8 boys) with ASD. They were on average 5.2 years old (SD=0.63), with mental age between 2 and 3 years. Their ASD diag- nosis was confirmed in clinical settings by a team of experts, including a psychol- ogist, speech and language pathologist, special educator, and paediatrician, and was based on the interview with parents and assessment of the child. All children met DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2014) diagnostic criteria for ASD. The second group consisted of 12 (2 girls, 10 boys) TD children. Children in this group were between 2 and 3 years old (on average 2.6 years old (SD=0.2) and without medical conditions that would interfere with participation in this study. The chronological ages of the two groups of participants were different, but their mental ages were the same. This means that we should expect the same level of cognitive infrastructure in both groups of children. Unfortunately, many studies did not consider the mental age of the children and only considered the chrono- Imitation and social behaviours in interaction with robots logical age. Furthermore, in some studies there were no cognitive measurements or even no mention of the participant's cognitive status (low-functioning or high- functioning ASD). Procedure After the initial interview, in which the study was explained and the consent of the parent was obtained, one parent entered the room with the participating child. Parents were instructed to behave neutrally during tasks. The room was 15 square metres large, with one couch on which the parent was asked to sit and a small desk where demonstrators (robot or human) performed the imitation task (see Figure 1).

Child focused on the robot demonstrator before presenting the imitation task Humanoid robot NAO H25 Atom was used as a robot demonstrator. Nao is a 58 cm tall humanoid robot with 25 degrees of freedom (DOF), and each hand has 5 DOFs. It has a humanoid look with simplified human characteristics that make it more attractive as an interactive partner for children (Shamsuddin et al., 2012). It is equipped with two high definition (720p) cameras, two speakers, four micro- phones and several other sensors, such as ultrasound range sensors, tactile sen- sors, force sensitive resistors, accelerometers, etc. It runs the OpenNAO operating system, based on the Gentoo Linux distribution, on an Intel Atom Z530 processor. More technical details are described in Petric et al. (2014) and Petric et al. (2017). > 6 Sanja SimleSa, Jasmina Sto8i¢, Irena Bili¢, and Maja Cepanec The imitation task was conducted on an individual basis in two conditions, one with the robot and one with a human demonstrator. The robot performed the targeted movement and gave verbal instructions in the robot trial, similar to humans in the human trial. The condition order was changed for each participant to reduce sequence effects. Both demonstrators were present in the room dur- ing the entire procedure. The task consisted of the presentation of an action with the toy frog followed by a verbal request for imitation (“Now you do it!”). The demonstrator showed the child the frog, made a frog-like arm movement, which represented the frog jumping, while reproducing the sound of a frog (“ribbit, rib- bit”). This task is a standardized task used in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2012). If the child performed a full imitation, the task was finished. The task was repeated up to three times in total, so the child had three opportunities to respond correctly. There were no practices before the task presentation. The robot was turned off during human trials, and the human was as neutral as possible during robot trials. The robot required some human assistance on two levels: (1) engineer controlling execution of the task in the room and/or outside the room where the experimental session was in progress (for example, pausing the execution if the child was not oriented towards robot); (2) examiner in the room helping the execution if necessary (for example, if the child takes the frog and throws it away, the human examiner would bring it back, which happened on few occasions). All conditions when assistance was disruptive were removed from the final analysis. Audio and video recordings were started when the child and parent entered the room and stopped after the child's performance on the last trial. Video analysis included coding of three groups of behaviours: imitation, focus of attention and social behaviours. A detailed description of the measures is presented in Table 1. Video analysis was completed by two independent observers who were blinded to the ASD status of the child. Interobserver agreement was measured on 20% of videos. Agreement between observers estimated by Cohen’ kappa values was 0.92. Imitation behaviours were coded for every trial as no imitation, partial imi- tation or full imitation). The presence or absence of attention focus and social behaviours were coded in each second during all trials and computed as the pro- portion of time each social behaviour was present. Proportion was used as an adequate measure of incidence due to differences in the duration of the child’s performance, as well as differences in the duration of demonstrations between the robot and the human.

Vocalization Results The number of children who imitated both conditions (robot as demonstrator and person as demonstrator) are shown in Table 2. The difference in the number of children who imitated the robot demonstrator between the group of TD chil- dren and children with ASD was calculated with the chi square test. The differ- ence in the number of children who imitated the person demonstrator between the group of TD children and children with ASD was also calculated with the chi square test. The results of Chi square test analysis found no differences between children with ASD and TD children in either condition (robot and human demonstrator) (p>.05). Descriptive statistical data on the focus of attention and social behaviours for both groups (the person demonstrator and robot demonstrator) are shown in 8 Sanja SimleSa, Jasmina Sto8i¢, Irena Bili¢, and Maja Cepanec Table 2.

There was no difference between groups in the focus on the object of imitation when either the robot or the human performed the frog movement. In the ASD group, Touch was more frequent in the robot demonstrator con- dition (Z=-2.440, p=.015) and Speech/Vocalization in the person demonstrator condition (Z=—3.019, p=.003). In the TD group, social interaction was more fre- quent in the robot demonstrator condition (Z=-2.444, p=.015). Differences in the focus of attention and social behaviours of children with ASD between the person demonstrator and robot demonstrator were assessed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and are presented in Table 5. The results show that gaze direction was more frequent in the robot demonstrator condition (Z=-2.475, p=.013) and focus on the object of imitation in the person demonstrator condition (Z=-1.963, p=.050).

Data has shown that many children never succeeded in imitating either. Children, sporadi- cally, in both groups, either showed no reaction or made some playful movements with the frog that were not similar to the target behaviour. It is assumed that vari- ous factors could have influenced this behaviour, including interest in frog, inter- est in the demonstrator, attention, and/or shyness. The results are therefore not in line with past studies that found that children with ASD imitated a robot more than a person (Pierno et al., 2008) or with research that found that children with Imitation and social behaviours in interaction with robots 11 ASD imitated a person more than a robot (Duquette et al., 2008). Other studies, however, are consistent with our findings that children did not imitate a robot more than a person (Duquette et al., 2008; Taheri et al., 2020; Tapus et al., 2012). It is possible that improving imitation skills are a priority for children with ASD, and a similar intervention, combined with verbal requests, is used in teach- ing imitation. In this way, children in the ASD group may have been in a familiar situation, which may make up for the greater ability of the TD group to imitate behaviour. Some TD children were cautious and observed tasks from a safe dis- tance, some observed first and made some actions on the second or third attempt, and a few approached the robot demonstrator or person demonstrator immedi- ately. Additionally, although children in both groups were equalized by mental age, they did not have the same level of imitation skills. The task may have been too easy for some TD children, and they perhaps did not find it attractive enough to perform it. Furthermore, performance on imitation tasks can also depend on interindividual differences between different children with ASD. Chevalier et al. (2017) found that performance might be connected with sensory preferences. In their study, children with more reliance on visual cues and hyporeactivity to pro- prioceptive cues performed better on imitation tasks. One other explanation is that children with low-functioning autism have more difficulty understanding the communication intent from the limited motion capabilities of the robot. Compared to TD children, children with ASD showed some behaviours that might indicate increased focus and interest of robots. Additionally, based on their behaviour, ASD children showed more interest in the robot demonstrator than the person (Figure 2). Compared to TD children, children with ASD touched the robots more often and interacted less with the people present in the room when robots were demon- strators. When a person was demonstrator, ASD children looked at the robot more often than TD children. These behaviours strongly suggest interest in robots and imply a possible preference of children with ASD towards robots rather than towards people. Previous research has also shown that children with ASD prefer to play with a robot more than with humans, have more positive attitudes towards robots (Costa et al., 2018) and are more engaged with robots than humans (Zheng et al., 2016). This can also indicate that children were more comfortable inter- acting with the robot than with the person. These results are in agreement with the studies that compared children’s attention towards a robot and towards a per- son and found that children with ASD directed more attention towards the robot (Aryania et al., 2020; Huijnen et al., 2017; Peca et al., 2015; Warren et al., 2015; Zubak et al., 2018). Social interaction was significantly more present in TD children than in ASD children under the robot demonstrator condition. This finding can be explained 12 Sanja SimleSa, Jasmina Sto8i¢, Irena Bili¢, and Maja Cepanec Human demonstrator Robot demonstrator Comparison b @@ * ®@ between A ah ° ath demonstrators (children with ASD) Gaze direction (demanstrator’ 4 Focus on object of imitation ‘ Human demonstrator Robot demonstrator Comparison i a between ETM, groups esd .

However, since differences between groups were noticed only when the robot was a demonstrator and not when the human demonstrator performed the task, it can be concluded that observed differences cannot be explained solely based on the communication skills of the ASD child, but might indicate higher focus of attention on robots in ASD children that does not “allow” them to simultaneously interact both with robots and humans. The only behaviour present at a higher rate in children with ASD than in TD children when the person was a demonstrator was the appear- ance of vocalization or speech, which was unexpected. Qualitative analysis of the study revealed that verbal imitation was not noticed in any ASD child and that most of the vocalization and speech was undirected, that is, did not serve social function. Therefore, it may be concluded that observed vocal behaviours might be self-stimulatory behaviours. When the behaviours of children with ASD were compared in the robot demonstrator and human demonstrator conditions, a higher incidence of gaze towards the demonstrator was noticed when the robot was the demonstrator, and a higher focus on the object of imitation (frog) was observed in the human demonstrator condition. It is possible that the increased interest in robot-directed Imitation and social behaviours in interaction with robots 13 behaviours of ASD children suggests that they more often look at robots and do not pay attention towards other objects. It is generally known that children with ASD aged 2-4 years are much less likely to initiate joint episodes, i.e., they have a lower ability to share and coordinate attention with another person and an object (Rice et al., 2016). In this case, that could mean that attention directed towards robot occupies their attention system and coordination of attention between robot and object of imitation is reduced. Shared attention challenges could be reduced in the human demonstrator condition due to less interest in humans. Although there is very different information on imitation in ASD, it is studied because this developmental skill is very complex, especially in the population of children with ASD who have unique cognitive infrastructure and are largely het- erogeneous. However, the focus of this paper is, not only on imitation, but also on the different patterns of behaviour children with ASD display when compared with TD children in two different learning settings, including the robot or human as demonstrator of the task. Additional information on their focus of attention and other social behaviours add to the quality of observed differences. Addition- ally, there is a clear experimental procedure, compared to clinical studies, and the existence of a control group, unlike many other studies (Chevalier et al., 2020; Jouaiti & Hénaff, 2019), which brings additional value. Furthermore, although previous studies included body movement imitation (for example Chevalier et al., 2017; Duquette et al., 2008; Ranatunga et al., 2013; Taheri et al., 2020), in this study, object imitation was the focus, which is occurs in fewer studies (for example Pierno et al., 2008). Therefore, the data serves as a starting point for a new, clearer, and detailed analysis of observed phenomena. The limitations of this study are similar to those of comparable studies, and include the small, nonrepresentative, convenience sample of participants from a university clinic or therapeutic centre in a large city. Although procedures were explained to the parent before the session started, some parents tried to direct their child during the procedure. It must also be noted, that children found many interesting toys in the waiting room, and some did not want to leave, which may have affected their attention and motivation levels. Other limitations are techni- cal, and included the robot performance that was not completely independent and needed the assistance of a person demonstrator, some dropping of objects and the robot falling, that could affect the behaviour of the children. This study, unlike others (Pierno et al., 2008; Pioggia et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2016), has shown that children with ASD do not imitate robots more than a per- son demonstrator, but confirms previous findings that children with ASD show interest and are motivated by robots (Duquette et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2013; Peca et al., 2015; Scassellati et al., 2012). In summary, the results show that robot use can be efficient in children with ASD. The fact that children direct more attention 14 Sanja SimleSa, Jasmina Sto8i¢, Irena Bili¢, and Maja Cepanec towards the robot and imitate the robot as much as a person represents increased learning opportunities for children with ASD. Therefore, it can be concluded that further research on the possibilities of using robots in ASD diagnosis and inter- vention can be valuable.
