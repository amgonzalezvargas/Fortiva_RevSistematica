Therefore, the interac- tive robots appear to be a promising approach for im- proving the social interaction and communication skills of autistic children. However, most of the existing inter- active robots use a very small number of communication variables which narrow their effectiveness to a few aspects of autistic childrens’ social communication behaviour. In the present work, we explore the effects of touching and colours on the communication effectiveness between a robot and an autistic child and their potential for further adjustability of the robot to child’s behaviour. Firstly, we investigated touching patterns of autistic and non-autistic children in three different situations and validated their re- sponses by comparison of touching forces. Results showed that patterns of touching by non-autistic children have cer- tain consistency, while reaction patterns in autistic chil- dren vary from person to person. Secondly, we studied the effect of colour feedback in autism therapy with the robot. Results showed that participants achieved better completion rate when colour feedback was provided. The results could support the design of more effective thera- peutic robots for children with autism.

Children with autism who are able to communicate in a better way with others have better per- spectives to integrate into society. It has been also found that such children reduce their abnormal behaviour when their communication ability is improved [1]. Autistic chil- dren’s behaviour affects the social climate within their families. Several studies have revealed that some children with autism tend to have aggressive behaviour toward their families. For example, Koegel et al, found that siblings with autism often demonstrate aggressive behaviours to- ward younger siblings [2]. Carr and Durand stress the importance of proper communication with children with autism, before they become aggressive [3]. Moes showed that the aggressive behaviour of children with autism of- ten causes huge amount of stress to their parents who fear that other siblings within the family could be injured by their aggressive autistic children [4]. The above studies ev- idence clearly the necessity of a systematic approach for development of communication abilities of children with autism. Numerous studies demonstrated that autistic chil- dren’s attention is engaged a much better way when they communicate with a robot than with a human [5, 6]. A possible reason for such behaviour could be the tendency of autistic children to prefer simple and predictable ob- jects, such as robot, rather than complicated ones, such as humans. Robins et al. confirmed that children with autism approached very easily to a mime artist wearing plain and featureless clothing, whereas they avoided the Goro Obinata: Department of Robotic Science and Technology, Chubu University, 1200 Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai, Aichi 487-8501, Japan, E-mail: obinata@isc.chubu.ac.jp Dimitar Stefanov: Faculty of Engineering and Computing, Coventry University, Priory Street, CV1 5FB, Coventry, United Kingdom E-mail: d.stefanov@coventry.ac.uk [KEE] © 2014 Jaeryoung Lee et al., licensee De Gruyter Open.

These research findings have suggested that robots may have strong positive therapeutic effects and indicated that the interaction with a robot can be used to help autistic children to develop better human-to-human communica- tion. Most of the existing approaches for communication improvement are based on encouraging the child to im- itate different facial expressions or behaviours of a hu- man communicator. Such approaches often have low ef- fectiveness because autistic children are inclined to avoid human’s face and thus, they do not show engagement in such exercises [7-10]. The therapy sessions, when or- ganised as an interaction between a robot and the child, tend to be effective because children usually demonstrate more interest in robots. Imitation of robot behaviour is a widely-used approach for development of communication Skills. Experimental results from several studies have con- firmed that autistic children are likely to imitate robots’ behaviour, in particular, to imitate robots that move their limbs or change their facial expression. Boccanfuso and O’Kane used a simple interactive robot called CHARLIE to show that autistic children tend to imitate a robot’s pose [11, 12]. Furthermore, Duquette et al. found that autis- tic children imitated more the facial expressions of their robot, named Tito, than the same facial expressions per- formed by a human [13]. Pioggia et al. used an android with highly realistic biological motion and appearance (FACE) in therapeutic sessions for helping autistic children to improve their emotion expression through imitation of robot’s behaviour [14, 15] . Feil-Seifer and Mataric devel- oped a modular interactive robot able to express differ- ent social behaviours in different situations by changing its facial expressions and gestures [16]. Robins et al. used a child-sized humanoid robot, Kaspar, with changeable facial expression, rotating head, and expressive postures and making gestures, to study the effect of the human- like appearance in therapeutic tasks for communication improvement and emotion expression of autistic children [17]. In their experiments, Duquette et al. used a wheel- based robot Tito that expressed different emotions via changing its face illumination and performing different gestures [13]. The Keepon robot was designed to express simple emotions via four actions: nodding, turning, rock- ing and bobbing [18]. In the majorities of those studies, researchers evaluated the therapeutic effect through di- rect observation or analysis of children’s responses from video records of the treatment session. Such evaluation approaches contain a high level of subjectivism in recog- nition of child’s reactions, which often leads to difficulties DE GRUYTER OPEN in assessing important communication skills, such as fa- cial expression response. The effectiveness of autistic treatment can be in- creased additionally if the interactive robot has the abil- ities to analyse a child’s behaviour and to respond to it ac- cordingly [19]. Figure 1 illustrates this approach. The inter- action effectiveness of the robot will increase if the modali- ties of the robot behaviour match the communication skills of the individual child. In our previous study, for exam- ple, we found that children responded in a better way than interactive robots that had faces and moving limbs [20]. A robot can be designed to encourage positive responses of the child during the therapy session. For example, the robot may perform a suitable encouraging gesture or may change its appearance when the child demonstrates be- haviour or social skills as expected. The provision of feed- back from the robot has the potential to improve child’s performance and stimulate their curiosity. In other words, by providing feedback to the child, the robot plays the role of an effective social mediator [19]. Assessing & Responding Autistic child’s behavior Autistic child Fig. 1. The interaction concept in robot-assisted autism therapy Various studies prove the importance of touch in the communication. "Touch is a crucial aspect of most human relationships" [21]. Touching as an approach for communi- cation with infants has been studied by many researchers. Knapp found that new-borns receive great amount of information about the surrounding world through tac- tile information [21]. Barnett claims that the touch pro- vides most fundamental means of contact with the ex- ternal world [22]. Hewett emphasises that communication through touch helps children with disabilities to develop a sense of connectedness with other people around them [23]. Bardeen indicates that touch can be stronger than other means of communication and specifies that touch is a means for sharing of feelings and sending information about personality [24]. Various studies emphasise that af- fective touch plays a crucial role in the regulation of hu- man emotions and psychological state [25-27]. The role of touch in the development of social skills in autistic children was explored in a few research studies, DE GRUYTER OPEN where the number of touch events was used for measure- ment of child’s engagement [28]. A study based on assess- ment of the touch type, location and pressure while autis- tic children interacted with the small humanoid robot, Kaspar was presented in [17]. In the present study, we pro- pose a new approach of touch training where the response of the robot is based on assessing a child’s performance during the present therapeutic session and considering the total time of the previous training and the level of autism in the child. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop an effec- tive interactive robot for children with autism. The present study is an initial step toward the robot design. This study aims to identify effective approaches for robot interaction that engage autistic children’s attention and facilitate bet- ter interaction with them. In this paper we present the re- sults of two experimental studies, named below as Study A and Study B. The first experimental study (Study A) exam- ined the parameters of the affective touch applied by autis- tic children to an interactive robot in a few different situa- tions. Patterns of affective interaction were used as mark- ers for evaluation of the child’s communication level with the robot. Another purpose of Study A was to explore the differences in the touching practices of autistic children. With the same study we also tried to verify the effective- ness of our approach for detecting children’s touching be- haviours. In the same study, we also compared the touch- ing patterns of non-autistic and autistic children. The sec- ond goal of this work was to explore the effect of colour on the interaction of the child with the robot, as described be- low in section 3, Study B. Based on the results of Study A, in Study B the children with autism were engaged in exper- imental therapeutic sessions that combined touching and colour feedback. The results from Study B provided further information on the role of colour for the level of engage- ment of the autistic children. 2 StudyA 2.1 Purpose of the Study It is anticipated that the abnormal touching behaviour of autistic children is due to their inability to understand social cues [29]. In this study, we explored the affective touch patterns of autistic children by comparing the way of touching between non-autistic and autistic children in different social situations and different interpersonal rela- tions. Enhancement of the communication effectiveness of interactive robots == 55 Many therapeutic approaches for development of cor- rect touch behaviour in autistic children consider a human mediator who uses simple illustrations and text to teach children the proper touch they need to use in different sit- uations. An example of such reference material is shown in Figure 2. It refers to a five point scale [30]. Hit strongly (only when you feel that it is dangerous to you) Bump (only when playing sports game) Petting Carrying a friend on your back Handshake Do not touch other people, when they are eating or studying Fig. 2. Teaching material for touching with social situations A disadvantage of such approach is that the force applied by the child is not measured quantitatively and the evaluation of child’s response depends entirely on the skills and experience of the human-mediator. Another drawback of the same approach is that the child may exert too high force in certain situations which may injure the teacher. In this study, our goal was to obtain quantitative in- formation about the way of touching. For that purpose, we developed a special interface that allowed measurement of the forces of touching applied by the children. 2.2 Method 2.2.1 Participants Six children (males) diagnosed with low-functioning autism and six non-autistic children (3 girls and 3 boys) took part in the experiments. The average ages (M) of the autistic children was 9.83 years and the standard deviation of their ages (SD) was 2.32 years. Non- autistic participants had M = 9.83 years and SD = 1.72 years. The level of im- pairment of each autistic participant was evaluated by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) from information pro- vided by the parents. The SRS is a quantitative scale for measurement of the severity and the type of autistic spec- trum disorders in children and adolescents [31]. A score of 75 or more indicates significant clinical levels of autistic 56 — _ Jaeryoung Lee, Hiroki Takehashi, Chikara Nagai, Goro Obinata, and Dimitar Stefanov traits.

SRS row Score in each participant 2.2.2 Procedure For the experiments we designed a special HMI called Touch Ball. In order to decide the shape of the interface device, we interviewed a few school teachers working with autistic children who suggested that autistic children like the shape of sphere. Also, from our previous study where we used a robot whose head was shaped as a transparent sphere, we also found that spherical shape attracts chil- dren’s attentions [20]. Based on these facts, we designed the test interface shown in Fig. 4. It consists of a transpar- ent half sphere (position 1 on Figure 4a) with a diameter of 12 cm connected to a base plate (position 2 on Figure 4b) via aa three-component force sensor (position 3 on Figure Ab).

On that figure, f,(0), fy(), and f-(t) are the signals from the three-component force sensor. During the experiments, three different figures rep- resenting a baby, a friend, and a mother were pro- jected on the computer screen. We used figures from DE GRUYTER OPEN At) tft) f(t) Fig. 5.

(a) (b) (c) Fig. 6. Three different figures representing a baby (a), a friend (b), and a mother (c) The participants took part in a total of nine virtual sce- narios of social interactions. They were required to per- form three different interpersonal interactions with each figure. The "social interactions" included giving a person high-five, waking a person up, and soothing a person. Each figure appeared on the laptop display together with a simple sentence that clarified expected interaction, as shown in Figure 7.

The sequence of the figures that appeared on the screen during the experiment and the instructions to the child about the interactions expected from him/her are summarised in Table 1. Each participant was asked to com- plete 3 sets of experiments. All sets contained all inter- actions listed in Table 1. Before starting the experiments, each participant took part in a pre-test session that in- cluded practicing of more than ten interaction situations. The pre-tests were done for avoiding eventual adaptation of the participants to the tests and evading ordering errors on the results. After the completion of the current interac- tion in the set, participants were given five seconds break before they started the next interaction task. Two minutes break was given to participants before they started the next set. 2.3 Data Analysis To evaluate individual performances of the children and to compare the responses of both groups, we analysed two features: the touching force and the manners of touching of the Touch Ball. 2.3.1 Time average of the contact force To compare the time average of the contact force used by the autistic and non-autistic children, we calculated the Enhancement of the communication effectiveness of interactive robots =——= 57 time average of contact force magnitude F, as expressed in Equation 1. Tr F=( / felt)? + fy(O2 + fe(02dT)/Dz (1) T Here, Ts is the time when the child starts to touch the Touch Ball and T; is the finishing time of the touch event. The duration of the touching action is Dr = Tr — Ts and fx(0, fy(O, and f,(t) are the force components measured by the three-component force sensor (see Figure 5). 2.3.2 Assessment of the manner of touching To evaluate the manner of touching, we analysed the tan- gential component of the contact force during touching. We calculated the ratio H between the horizontal projec- tion and the contact force magnitude applied to the Touch Ball, as in Equation 2. f(t)? + VJ f(t)? + f(t)? - | Flt)? + fy(O2 + flO? aD Pr 2) The time interval when the child touches the sphere is Dy = Tr — Ts, where Ts is the time when the child starts touching and Ty; is the time when the touching finishes. 2.3.3 Normalisation of F and H In order to remove the individual bias, the data were nor- malised by using Equation 3. Here F is the mean of F, and O; is standard deviation. F-F — (3) The ratio H is also normalised in terms of all six autis- tic children and six non-autistic children, as in Equation 4. Here, H is the mean of H, and Gy is the standard deviation. ZE >= H-H OH (4) ZH = 2.4 Results The changes of the z values of the forces used by the groups of the autistic and non-autistic children in the different sit- uations are illustrated in Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11. The result in Figure 8 shows that the force used by non-autistic children to give a high five is stronger than 58 -—— the force that they use for soothing or wake-up. As shown in Figure 9, the time average of the contact forces for autis- tic children indicates slightly different patterns comparing with the forces used by the non-autistic children.

The result in figure 10 shows that the force ratio H for the non-autistic children for the situation of soothing a person is stronger than H for giving high-five or waking a person up. As a difference, we did not discover any pat- terns in the H ratios of the autistic children (Figure 11). The experimental results are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

Estimating the horizontal projection in the experiment with autistic children For the non-autistic children, the results on the time average of the contact force show that the responses of the autistic children in the interpersonal relationship or so- cial situations differ from the results of the non-autistic children. The results show that the manner of touching of the non-autistic children is quite consistent in all in- terpersonal relationships and all three social situations. Differently from that, the results of the autistic children show some irregularities, except the result for the horizon- tal projection in different social situations. DE GRUYTER OPEN Table 2.

Further to that, we also explored the effect of colour-based feedback on the communication effectiveness of autistic children and investigated the colour feedback effective- ness when different colours are used. We also compared the force response of autistic and non-autistic children to colour stimuli. The results of that study are introduced be- low. Many previous studies reported on the effect of colour on communication with persons with autism. For exam- ple, Moore noticed that children with autism seem ob- sessed by colours when they describe their parents [32]. Brian et al. observed that the usage of colours increased communication results of children with autism during ex- periments [33]. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Participants Four children diagnosed with low-functioning autism without other complications took part in the experiments. Participants were aged from 9 to 12 years (M = 10.75, SD = 2.06, males).

For the new experiments, we used a small projector to illuminate the surface of the half-sphere of the Touch Ball and to change its colours to red, yellow, blue, and green. In addition to the Touch Ball, we included in the test scenario a small humanoid robot, called Palro? which was developed by Fujisoft Inc. The same robot is shown in Figure 12. The role of the robot was to attract the child’s at- tention toward the experiment by speaking to the child or changing randomly the direction of its head. Fig. 12. Small humanoid robot, Palro 3.2.3 Procedure Before the start of the experiment, we established the or- der of preference of each child to each colour. Preliminary tests aimed to identify the colour that causes negative per- ception to the individual participant and to exclude the same colour from the following experiments with the same participant. For that purpose, children were shown all four 2 http://palro.jp/ 60 — Jaeryoung Lee, Hiroki Takehashi, Chikara Nagai, Goro Obinata, and Dimitar Stefanov colours and were asked to choose a favourite colour anda colour that they hate. Then, during the next experiments the favourite colour was used as the goal and the most dis- liked colour was excluded from the experiments. For ex- ample, if a child chose blue for a favourite colour and red for a hated colour, the blue colour was set as a dominant colour and yellow and green were used as signs, while the red colour was excludes from all trials in which the child was involved. This way, we defined the individual sets of three colours for each child. The experiments included three different scenarios, as illustrated with Figure 13. &» eS Eo P| M P| M P| M (a) (b) (c) Fig. 13. The arrangement of experimental environment. (a) Scenario with illuminated half-sphere; (b) scenario with changing colour of the circle on the computer screen; (c) scenario with only verbal notification. T: Touch Ball, P: Participant, M: Moderator In the first scenario (Figure 13a), the colours were in- troduced to the child by changing the colour of the Touch Ball. In the second scenario, the colour information was presented on a laptop display as a circle with 12 cm di- ameter, which was the same as the diameter of the Touch Ball (Figure 13b). In the third scenario, colours were not presented visually but instead, the participant received speech feedback about the colour by a moderator (Figure 13c). In the first set of trials (Figure 13a), the computer al- gorithm was set to change the colour of the Touch Ball de- pending on the magnitude of the force applied to its sur- face. Children were asked to apply force to the half-sphere until it becomes illuminated in their favourite colour. In the second experiment (Figure 13b) children needed to change the colour of the circle on the laptop screen by pushing the half-sphere. In the third experiment (Figure 13c), the force F, applied by the child to the Touch Ball was measured and shown on the computer screen of the moderator who provided verbal information about the colour. The forces, applied to the half-sphere during the experiment and the colour responses of the system were recorded. DE GRUYTER OPEN Table 4. Sequence of the virtual social situations (as they appear on the screen) and expected response by the participants Pre-trial | First/Second/Third scenario (Randomly) Trial 1 First scenario Break Trial 2 First scenario Break Trial 3 Second scenario Break Trial 4 Second scenario Break Trial 5 Third scenario Break Trial 6 Third scenario All participants were included in all three scenarios. Each child repeated twice each scenario. This way, each child performed six trials. Thirty seconds breaks were given between the start of the next trial. Before the tri- als, the children were asked to perform randomly some scenarios. That allowed them to understand the tests and the responses expected from them. During the preparatory stage, the moderator explained to the children how to use the Touch Ball and ensured that they feel comfortable dur- ing the tests. The sequence of the tests is shown in Table 4. In all three trials children needed to set their favourite colour by touching the Touch Ball and increasing the ap- plied force until the favourite colour appeared. Depending on the value of the force F;, the colours changed in the fol- lowing order: The favourite colour of the child appeared when a moderate force was applied to the sphere. The less preferred colour (the second colour in the individual list of colour preferences) appeared when low force was applied. The least preferred colour (the third in the list) appeared when maximum force was applied. The sphere remained dark when no force was applied. The force F,, applied to the half-sphere was calculated in the following way (Equation 5): Fo = \/fx(t)? + fy(0? + felt)? (5) where F; is the magnitude of the contact force and f(O, fy), and f-(t) are the force components in the axial directions. Table 5 shows an example of the relationships between the force F. and the selected colour for a child whose colour set has blue as the least preferred colour and red as the favourite colour. During the pre-trials, some chil- dren found it a bit difficult to select moderate force. DE GRUYTER OPEN Table 5.

The TKT is defined Equa- tion 6. In our experiments, each scenario task was exe- cuted for test time E; = 20[s]. The success ratio for keeping the favourite colour can be called target keeping rate (TKR) and can be defined as the ratio between the target keeping time and the test time, as in Equation 7. n TKT = Ss” t; (6) i=1 TKR = (a) ~ 100 (7) T 3.4 Results During the trials, the target keeping time of each scenario was recorded.

As shown in the same graph, two of the participants with autism, M (age 9) and K (age 12)achieved highest rate for the completion of the first scenario. Their target keep- ing ratio for the second scenario was lower than the re- sult from the first scenario. Other two autistic children (Y (age 9) and H (age 11)) achieved slightly higher results on the second scenario comparing to their results from first scenario.

The target keeping rate in each trials with three different scenarios We monitored participants’ behaviour during the com- pletion of the tests. Some specifics of participants’ be- haviour during each trial are presented in Table 7. 4 Discussion As indicated in the literature review, the touching be- haviour is an essential communicative function of the autistic children and they need to be trained to develop abilities to select proper force for each interaction situa- tion. For more accurate evaluation of the touching man- ners, we used a special HMI system (TouchBall) as an in- teractive training tool. In Study A, the analysis of partici- pant responses in several test situations showed that the autistic children and the non-autistic children used dif- ferent amount of force to respond to the same interac- tion scenario. The analysis of the test results showed that non-autistic children were much more consistent in their touching behaviour in all three different social situations, while the autistic children were unable to choose proper touch levels relevant to various social situations. A pos- sible reason for the different touch response of the autis- tic children could be the lack of imagination ability. It has been found that often autistic children concentrate on very small details instead of seeing the whole situation[34]. The results from Study B demonstrated that the combination of touch and colour feedbacks is effective. In the first and the second scenarios, children referred to visual informa- tion (presented with the changing colours of the sphere or the circle on the screen), while the substitution of the colour feedback with a verbal message about the colour in the third scenario led to lower performance. The level of performance also depended on the method of display- ing the colour information. When colours were projected directly on the Touch Ball in the first scenario, the comple- 62 — Table 7.

The results demonstrated that the colour feedback influenced touch training positively for autistic children. 5 Conclusion and Future work The method of communication of a robot with autistic children should be organized on a way that not only at- tracts children’s attention but also elicits positive percep- tion from the children. The feedback provided by the in- teractive robot to the child is an important issue for effec- tive interaction in robot-assisted therapy. The results pre- sented in this paper show that robotic feedback based on touch and colour could increase the efficiency of interac- tive robots for improvement of the communication ability of autistic children. Results from this study showed that autistic children used different levels of forces and man- ners of touch than the non-autistic children who partici- pated in the same experiments. The colour feedback ex- periments showed that the colour feedback can be under- stood easier by children with autism who are hyposensi- tive or hypersensitive. In this study, we analysed the re- sponse of a limited number of participants and that is why the present study cannot pretend to strong conclusions, but still it shows some important tendencies in the re- sponse of autistic children to visual and colour stimuli that need to be studied in further details in the future. We be- lieve that this study can contribute to better design of robot for improvement of the communication skills of children with autism.
