Forty-four participants with autism spectrum disorder aged 3-8 years (Pivotal Response Treatment: n= 20, Pivotal Response Treatment + robot: n=24), who were recruited as part of a larger randomized controlled trial (number NL4487/NTR4712, https://www.trialregister.nl/ trial/4487), were included. Self-initiations were blindly coded, assessing video probes of all parent—child sessions using an event-recording system. General social-communicative skills were assessed with the parent- and teacher- rated Social Responsiveness Scale during intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Results using linear mixed-effects models showed overall gains in self-initiations during both Pivotal Response Treatment intervention groups (estimate = 0.43(0.15), 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.13—-0.73), with larger gains in functional self-initiations in children receiving robot-assisted Pivotal Response Treatment (estimate =—-0.27(0.12), 95% confidence interval: -0.50 to —0.04). Growth in self-initiations was related to higher parent-rated social awareness at follow-up compared with baseline in the total sample (r=—0.44, p=0.011). The clinical implications of these findings, as well as directions for future research in the utility of Pivotal Response Treatment and robot assistance in autism spectrum disorder intervention, are discussed. Lay abstract The initiation of social interaction is often defined as a core deficit of autism spectrum disorder. Optimizing these self-initiations is therefore a key component of Pivotal Response Treatment, an established intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder. However, little is known about the development of self-initiations during intervention and whether this development can be facilitated by robot assistance within Pivotal Response Treatment. The aim of this study was to (I) investigate the effect of Pivotal Response Treatment and robot-assisted Pivotal Response Treatment on self-initiations (functional and social) of young children with autism spectrum disorder over the course of intervention and (2) explore the relation between development in self-initiations and additional gains in general social-communicative skills. Forty-four children with autism spectrum disorder (aged 3—8 years) were included in this study.

General social-communicative skills were assessed before start of the treatment, after 10 and 20 weeks of intervention and 3 months after the treatment was finalized. Results showed that self-initiations increased in both treatment groups, with the largest improvements in functional self-initiations in the group that received robot-assisted Pivotal Response Treatment. Increased self-initiations were related to higher parent-rated social awareness 3 months after finalizing the treatment. Keywords autism spectrum disorders, Pivotal Response Treatment, robot-assisted intervention, self-initiations Deficits in social communication form one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) and have a pro- found negative impact on various domains of functioning such as school performance, friendship and relationships (Bauminger & Kasari, 2000; Koegel, Koegel, Shoshan, & McNerney, 1999). Self-initiations (i.e. the ability to spon- taneously initiate a social interaction), such as question- asking and commenting, occur infrequently or are absent in children with ASD (Koegel et al., 2003). The results of a large-scale national survey of the Dutch Autism Society (1 =4068) demonstrated that diminished self- initiations in social contact are the most frequently reported maladaptive behaviours in children with ASD (Begeer et al., 2013). Furthermore, self-initiation is sug- gested to be a ‘pivotal’ (core) skill for the development of other social-communicative skills, as lower self-initi- ations are related to less naturally occurring opportunities for social communication (Koegel et al., 2003). This per- vasive problem highlights the need for appropriate inter- ventions promoting social communication for children with ASD. Interventions integrating Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) and developmental principles have become the predominant approaches for treating the core symptoms of children with ASD (Ona et al., 2019; Ospina et al., 2008). These interventions involve a manualized approach that 1s balanced with individualized, naturalistic and motivational procedures, high involvement of family members and ongoing monitoring of progress (Fuller & Kaiser, 2019; Ospina et al., 2008; Rogers & Vismara, 2008). Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), derived from ABA, incorpo- rates all of these intervention components. This interven- tion is based on the assumption that targeting pivotal areas of impairment in ASD, such as self-initiations and motiva- tion for social contact, will induce widespread gains in other areas of functioning and skills (Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, & Carter, 1999). PRT includes strategies to cre- ate learning opportunities for self-initiations, such as fol- lowing the child’s interests, gaining the child’s attention, giving appropriate levels of help (prompting), providing immediate and contingent reinforcement in response to the child’s initiation or good attempt and _ interspersing maintenance and acquisition tasks (Koegel & Koegel, 2006, 2019). The involvement of parents is a key compo- nent to increase the generalization of learned skills into daily routines. A systematic review indicated the effectiveness of PRT in enhancing self-initiations and collateral improvements in language and communication skills such as increase in verbal utterances, social response and maintaining interac- tions (Verschuur et al., 2014). However, previous studies did not examine growth in self-initiations and gains in gen- eral social-communicative skills in direct relation to each other but rather reported results on both outcomes sepa- rately. Furthermore, most studies on PRT targeted self- initiations in general without distinguishing between subtypes of communicative intentions such as functional initiations (e.g. asking for objects, help, or information) and social initiations (e.g. requesting social information and commenting; Verschuur et al., 2019). However, out- comes in self-initiations may differ depending on the com- municative intentions of the self-initiations that are under study. Studies using single-subject designs indicated that PRT may enhance self-initiations such as asking ‘what is it?’, ‘where is it?’ and ‘who is it?’ (Koegel et al., 2014) and asking for an object/activity (Vernon etal., 2012). Furthermore, mixed results were reported by studies that incorporated a more comprehensive definition of self-in1- tiations, including — in addition to the questions as men- tioned above — question-asking about the other’s opinion or previous experiences, commenting and starting to talk about a new subject (Huskens et al., 2012; Kuhn et al., 2008; Verschuur et al., 2019). Besides variation in defini- tions in self-initiations, PRT studies vary widely in treat- ment duration and intensity (ranging from 66 min to 60h) and implementation strategies (Cadogan & McCrimmon, 2015; Ona et al., 2019; Verschuur et al., 2014). These dif- ferences between studies complicate the understanding of how self-initiations develop over the course of PRT, how this development is related to collateral improvements in social communication and which components may con- tribute to effectiveness of the intervention. The use of robot assistance has been raised as a possible effective component of interventions for children with ASD (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2004; Diehl et al., 2012). De Korte et al. 2119 Robots are often appealing to children with ASD, because robot behaviour is predictable, consistent and easy to adjust in different levels of complexity (Gillesen et al., 2011; Scassellati, 2007). This potentially contributes to a more enjoyable and child-friendly learning environment in which children can practice self-initiations and interchange without social pressures (Diehl et al., 2012). Among chil- dren with ASD who received robot-assisted interventions, increases in self-initiations (Huskens et al., 2013) and gen- eral social-communicative skills (Boccanfuso et al., 2017) were observed. However, due to limitations in study design, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the additional value of robot assistance on the effectiveness of the inter- vention. In addition, many studies on robot assistance in ASD interventions are limited by methodological prob- lems such as small sample sizes and a lack of control group (Diehl et al., 2012; Ismail et al., 2019). This highlights the need for rigorously designed studies on the effectiveness of robot assistance in established interventions such as PRT, investigating development in targeted behaviour (i.e. self-initiations) over the course of intervention and how this relates to collateral changes in untargeted, general social-communicative skills. The current study aimed to address this need by (1) investigating the effect of PRT versus robot-assisted PRT on self-initiations of young children with ASD over the course of intervention in the Netherlands, distinguishing between functional and social self-initiations and (2) exploring the relation between growth in self-initiations and possible collateral gains in general social-communica- tive skills at the end of PRT intervention and at 3-month follow-up. We hypothesized that both PRT and robot- assisted PRT would be effective in increasing self-initia- tions and that growth in self-initiations would be related to gains in general social-communicative skills. Furthermore, we expected that children receiving robot-assisted PRT would show a larger growth in self-initiations and higher gains in general social-communicative skills compared to children receiving PRT. Methods Study design This study was part of a larger three-armed randomized clinical trial (RCT) to the effectiveness of PRT, with and without the use of robot assistance, compared to treatment- as-usual (TAU) in the Netherlands (registered in Dutch National Trial Register, number NL4487/NTR4712; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/4487). Random assign- ment to (1) PRT, (2) robot-assisted PRT or (3) TAU was performed with stratification by age, total intelligence quotient (TIQ), and site by an investigator not involved in data collection and outcome assessment. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CMO) Arnhem-Niymegen, NL50509.091.14) and written consent was obtained from all families. The current in-depth study only used data from both PRT groups. Participants Participants were children with ASD referred for interven- tion at Karakter, an expert multi-site centre for child and adolescent psychiatry in the Netherlands. They were recruited with the following inclusion criteria: (1) a clini- cal diagnosis of ASD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revi- sion; DSM-IV-TR) algorithm (APA, 2004); (2) age of 3-8 years; (3) a TIQ of 70 or higher; (4) ability to speak with one-word utterances at minimum; and (5) at least one Dutch-speaking parent. An exclusion criterion was having received PRT earlier. Comorbid psychiatric disorders of the child were allowed, but the primary diagnosis had to be ASD (and subsequently the primary intervention was focused on ASD). Before the start of the intervention period of PRT (with and without robot assistance), dosages of medication had to be stable. However, participants were not excluded if dosages changed during the intervention due to the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Procedures Parents of potential participants were approached by clini- cians of Karakter. If parents were interested, information letters of the study were provided. Parents gave written informed consent when they agreed with the participation of their child. If children met the inclusion criteria, par- ticipants were randomized. In each condition, parents received psycho-education on ASD before the treatment, individually or in a group. PRT and robot-assisted PRT consisted of 20 weekly sessions in which self-initiations were targeted using the motivational techniques of PRT (Koegel, 2014; Koegel & Koegel, 2012). Treatment was delivered by certified PRT therapists trained up until level III, with a reached fidelity score of over 80%. A total of 13 PRT therapists participated in this study. In both treatment groups, implementation of learning oppor- tunities during PRT sessions was in line with the used PRT manual (Koegel & Koegel, 2012), and parent train- ing, intensity and duration of the intervention were sim1- lar across both groups. Of the PRT sessions in both treatment groups, 14 were parent—child sessions, 4 were parent-only sessions and in 2 sessions the child’s teacher was involved. Each session had a duration of 45 min, except for one teacher session including a 90 min school/ daycare visit. Parent-child sessions were recorded on video for later analysis. PRT. In the PRT condition, parent-child sessions consisted of practicing PRT strategies during parent-child play. The therapist modelled the techniques and subsequently 2120 Autism 24(8) coached the parents in applying the techniques during interaction with their child. During the parent-only ses- sions, the progress of the child was discussed as well as the use of PRT techniques by parents. The child’s teacher was involved by being briefed about PRT and how to practice it at school/day care. Robot-assisted PRT (PRT + robot). In the robot-assisted PRT condition, the programmable humanoid robot NAO was used in the parent—child sessions. This robot can move its arms, legs and head and thus have expressive gestures. The TiViPE programming environment was used for develop- ing the game scenarios for robot—child interaction (Barak- ova et al., 2013). Two interfaces were developed, one for creating the interactive robot behaviours and one text-to- speech module for additional intervention during the inter- action. The game scenarios were pre-programmed in a flexible way, so the robot could act according to the child’s choice or following child’s initiation or response (see Sup- plementary Material S1 for details). These game scenarios for robot—child interaction were controlled by the PRT therapist and used in the first 15—20 min of each session for practicing the target behaviour of the child. Parents were seated close to the child and were asked to observe how the PRT techniques were practised by the therapist using the robot. Specifically, the therapist modelled the techniques to the parent by controlling the robot. Game scenarios for robot—child interaction were devel- oped based on motivational techniques of PRT and a three- step contingency was used: (1) the therapist controlled the robot in providing an antecedent stimulus, (2) the therapist controlled the robot in prompting the child in showing tar- get behaviour and (3) the therapist controlled the robot in reinforcing the (attempt to) target behaviour naturally and contingently. Nine different game scenarios were created with seven levels of complexity each. After the robot- assisted part of the session, parents were coached by the therapist in practicing the techniques during interactions with their child. The content of the parent sessions and ses- sions with the involvement of the child’s teacher were similar to the PRT condition. Fidelity of PRT implementation. Fidelity of PRT Implemen- tation of parents at the end of the intervention was meas- ured using the partial interval recording procedure as described in the study of Verschuur et al. (2020), in which fidelity criteria are based on a sequence of correctly imple- mented PRT components, instead of coding each PRT component separately. Video probes of 10 minutes of the last two recorded parent—child sessions were coded by a trained research assistant, blinded to group assignment. A mean of these two was calculated to determine the total percentage of fidelity for each parent. Of the video probes, 20% was coded by a naive second rater resulting in excel- lent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient =0.97). Measures Demographics and participant/parent characteristics. Demo- graphics and participant/parent characteristics (i.e. age, gender, total intelligent quotient (TIQ), psychiatric comor- bidity, medication use, psychopathology parents, educa- tional level of parents) were retrieved from electronic medical records. If TIQ was not assessed within 2 years before start of the study, it was estimated by either the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Kort et al., 2005), Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelli- gence (Hendriksen & Hurks, 2009) or Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Mullen, 1995), depending on age. Partici- pant ASD symptom severity at baseline was retrieved from calibrated severity scores (CSS; Gotham et al., 2009) of the Dutch version of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (De Bildt et al., 2013). Self-initiations. The development of self-initiations of the participant was assessed using videotaped parent—child play interactions of all parent-child PRT sessions. An event-recoding scheme was developed to code the number of self-initiations, in which only initiations considered as verbal, spontaneous (i.e. without prompting) and appropri- ate within the context were scored. Play sounds, undirected verbal utterances and echolalia were not scored. In order to distinguish different communicative intentions, self-initia- tions were coded as either functional (related to parent— child play context; requesting for object/activity, help, information and protesting) or social (early social conver- sational skills; asking for social information, opinion, com- menting). In Supplementary Material S2, examples of these subtypes of self-initiations are listed. Total self-initiations were determined by summing the spontaneous functional and social self-initiations. Six minutes video probes of each parent-child session were used for coding, in which the start- ing point of the video probe was defined as the moment the child had chosen a game to play. Two raters (master level students), naive to group allocation, were trained in PRT principles and the coding scheme by the first authors of this study (MdK and IvdB), both certified PRT level III thera- pists. After training, both MdK and IvdB served as second raters on 20% of the videos, resulting in excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.92, 0.90 and 0.87 for total self-initiations, functional self-initiations and social self-initiations, respectively). Self-initiations change scores were computed between baseline and endpoint for total, functional and social self-initiations. Baseline scores were based on the mean amount of self-initiations in the first two parent-child sessions and endpoint scores were based on the mean amount of self-initiations in the last two parent—child sessions. General socia-communicative skills. Collateral gains in general social-communicative skills were assessed with the Social De Korte et al. 2121 Responsiveness Scale (SRS; Constantino & Gruber, 2005; Roeyers et al., 2011) child version and preschool version. The 65-item digitalized questionnaires, rated on a 4-point scale, were completed by both the participant’s parent(s) and teacher/daycare attendant at baseline, intermediate assessment (week 10), endpoint (week 20) and follow-up (week 32) as part of the larger randomized controlled trial. In the current in-depth study, we only investigated change in general social-communicative skills at endpoint and follow-up. The SRS consist of the following subscales: Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social Communica- tion, Social Motivation and Restricted Interests and Repet- itive Behaviour. Scores for each subscale and total raw scores were computed, with higher scores representing lower general social-communicative skills. SRS change scores were computed for the total score and subscales between baseline and endpoint and between baseline and follow-up. Statistical analyses Between-group analyses using one-way analysis of vari- ance (ANOVA; or a non-parametric equivalent) for con- tinuous measures and chi-square analysis for categorical measures were conducted to examine whether descriptive characteristics, baseline self-initiations and total SRS scores, and hours of treatment differed between the groups. Outliers were identified with the use of boxplots and, when necessary, adjusted to quartile (Q)1—1.5 x interquartile range (IQR) and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR to obtain a normal distri- bution. For all analyses, a was set on 0.05 (two-tailed). The development of self-initiations over time for both groups (PRT and PRI'+ robot) was assessed with linear mixed-effects models, using the Imer function of the Ime4 package (Bates et al., 2015) in R (version 3.4.0; R Core Team [Pinheiro et al., 2017]). Separate analyses were performed for total self-initiations, functional self-initiations and social self-initiations. Data on self-initiations were available on 14 measurement occasions (1.e. 14 parent-child PRT sessions, distributed over 20 weeks of intervention). Because of hetero- geneity among participants in intercepts (number of self- initiations in session 1) and slope (change over time; see Supplementary Figure S3), a per-participant random adjust- ment to the fixed intercept and the slope of time were included in the model besides the fixed effects for time (weeks), group (PRT vs PRT + robot) and the interaction effects between time and group. Confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived from the function confint in R (R Core Team [Pinheiro et al., 2017]), with CI that do not include zero indicating signifi- cant estimates. Change over time in general social-communicative skills was assessed with paired-samples t-tests. Furthermore, to examine between-group differences (PRT vs PRT + robot) in the change in general social-communica- tive skills, independent sample t-tests were conducted on SRS change scores. Correlational analyses on the total sample were conducted to explore the relationship between change in self-initiations (total, functional and social) and change in general social-communicative skills after PRT intervention in general (baseline vs endpoint and baseline vs follow-up). Results Study population Fifty-two participants were assigned to either the PRT group or the PRT + robot group. Two participants allo- cated to the PRT group did not start with the intervention nor received a baseline assessment because of the need to switch to another intervention for comorbid problems. As a result, 50 participants started with the treatment to which they were assigned. Of these participants, 6 were excluded from the analyses as they had video recordings of less than 4 PRT sessions, due to early termination of the intervention or due to technical problems with the recording of video data. This resulted in a total of 44 participants who were included 1n this study, with 20 participants in the PRT group and 24 partici- pants in the PRT + robot group. Of the included participants, 91% scored above the ASD cut-off of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), with 2 participants (4.5%) scoring | point below and 2 participants (4.5%) scoring 2 points below the cut-off. Participants scor- ing below the ASD cut-off were equally distributed across groups (Fisher’s exact test: p= 1.000). Table 1 shows descriptive statistics, baseline scores and hours of treatment for both groups, with the results of between-group analyses. As expected due to randomization, no significant differences existed between the groups. The mean number of PRT sessions was 17 and 18 in the PRT and PRT + robot group, respectively, and did not significantly differ between the groups (#(42)=0.96, p=0.345). None of the parents in both PRT groups showed adherence to the 80% fidelity of PRT implementation criterion at the end of treatment and this differed significantly between groups (PRT: 36.3%; PRT + robot: 19.8%, #(31)=2.19, p=0.037). Development of self-initiations over time Figure | shows the linear growth in total self-initiations over time for both groups. There were no significant baseline dif- ferences between groups. Mixed-model analysis showed a significant main effect of time, Estimate=0.43(0.15), 95% CI: 0.13—0.73. For the interaction effect between time and group, a marginal trend towards significance was found, Estimate =—0.19 (0.10), 95% CI: —0.38 to 0.02. For functional self-initiations, a significant main effect of time was found, Estimate =0.44(0.18), 95% CI: 0.09— 0.79, as well as a significant interaction effect between time and group, Estimate=—0.27(0.12), 95% CI: —0.50 to 2122 Autism 24(8) Table |.

Change in general social-communicative skills and relation with self-initiations In Table 2, the mean and SD scores on self-initiations (total, functional, social), parent-rated and teacher-rated SRS total and subscale scores are presented for both groups separately and for the whole sample. The total score of the parent-rated SRS decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint (¢(42)=5.68, p<0.001) and from baseline to follow-up (#(43)=5.02, p< 0.001) in the total sample. The total score of the teacher-rated SRS also decreased signifi- cantly from baseline to endpoint (#(38)=2.78, p=0.009), but not from baseline to follow-up (#(37)= 1.64, p=0.110). The change on the parent-rated SRS from baseline to follow-up (but not from baseline to endpoint) was signifi- cantly larger (#(42)=—2.65, p=0.011) in the PRT + robot group compared with the PRT group.

No significant between-group differ- ences were found for the change scores on the Social Awareness and Social Cognition subscales of the parent- rated SRS and on the total score and subscales of the teacher-rated SRS. The relation between change in self-initiations (total, functional, social) and change in general social-communi- cative skills after PRT was examined for the whole sample. Only the change score from baseline to follow-up on the Social Awareness subscale of the parent-rated SRS was significantly related to the change score on total self-initi- ations (r=—0.44, p=0.011) and functional self-initiations (r=—0.42, p=0.016), but not to social self-initiations (r=—0.09, p=0.638). No significant correlations were found between change in self-initiations (total, functional, social) and the other parent-rated SRS scales. There were also no significant correlations between change in self- initiations (total, functional, social) and any of the teacher- rated SRS scales. Discussion The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PRT versus robot-assisted PRT on increasing functional and social self-initiations of young children with ASD over the course of the intervention and to explore the relation with collateral gains in general social-communicative skills at the end of the intervention and at 3-month follow-up. This study is the first in examining the effect of robot assistance during PRT on the development of self-initiations, using mixed-effect models to account for individual differences in baseline self-initiations and changes over time. We expected growth in self-initiations in both groups and hypothesized that growth in self-initiations would be related to gains in general social-communicative skills. Moreover, we hypothesized that children receiving robot- assisted PRT would show a larger growth in self-initiations and higher gains in general social-communicative skills compared to children receiving PRT. The results indicated growth in total self-initiations over the course of a 20-week intervention for both the PRT and robot-assisted PRT group. Regarding the subtypes of communicative intention of self-initiations, children in the robot-assisted PRT group showed a larger growth in func- tional self-initiations, compared to the PRT group. There were no group differences in growth in social self-initia- tions. Furthermore, the results showed that both PRT and robot-assisted PRT interventions were effective in improv- ing general social-communication skills, with larger improvements for the robot-assisted PRT group. However, we did not find significant correlations between change in self-initiations and change in most of the scales for general social-communicative skills; we only found an association between change in self-initiations and parent-rated social awareness. The higher gains in both self-initiations and general social-communicative skills in the robot-assisted PRT group may be explained by the intrinsic interest in robotics of many children with ASD, which may be related to higher motivation for treatment (Scassellati, 2007). Motivation is considered a pivotal area in treatment (Koegel et al., 2001) Autism 24(8) "ayeas ssouaddlsuodsay jeld0S :Sys ‘UOIIVIAOP PuepuRys :GS ‘JudWIee4 | BsUOdsay |eIOAIY 1 Yd Jnolaeyag daijiqyedau (11's) 066 (6r9) trol (hzs) SIO!

Furthermore, the robot was a consistent factor in treatment, because it was always added in the first 15min of the parent-child sessions and there was high similarity in robot behaviour across sessions. Since children with ASD show higher intolerance of uncer- tainty and this is related to higher levels of anxiety in these children (Neil et al., 2016), predictability may have low- ered their anxiety and positively affected their learning curve. However, in this intervention, the enhancing effect of robot assistance was found for functional self-initiations and not for social self-initiations (i.e. early social conver- sational skills). A possible explanation is that within the game scenarios for robot—child interaction, a higher focus may have been placed on eliciting self-initiations related to the direct play context (i.e. the game that the child played with the robot). Also, the reinforcements provided by the robot showed a short delay, which was particularly the case for reinforcement of social self-initiations as these were mainly provided by a text-to-speech module (i.e. typ- ing of the reinforcement sentence caused a delay) and were not pre-programmed. This may also have limited generali- zation of these types of self-initiations to the parent—child interaction. Our results are in line with studies that reported increases in self-initiations (Huskens et al., 2013) and gen- eral social-communicative skills (Boccanfuso et al., 2017) among children receiving a robot-assisted intervention. Contrary to earlier studies that showed design limitations, our study allowed the comparison of a group that received robot-assisted intervention with a group that did not receive robot-assistance in their intervention. Furthermore, this study involved (1) further differentiation of self-initia- tions based on communicative intention, (2) a higher num- ber of intervention sessions, (3) higher differentiation in levels of prompting and (4) a larger library of game sce- narios for robot—child interaction with varying levels of complexity. Although we found improvements in self-initiations over the course of PRT and also gains in general social- communicative skills after PRT, improvements in self- initiations were not related to gains in most aspects of general social-communicative skills of children with ASD. As the underlying assumption of PRT is that targeting the pivotal skill of self-initiation contributes to collateral gains in other functioning areas (Koegel & Koegel, 2006, 2019), we expected stronger relations between self-initiation and SRS change scores. On one hand, the differences in meas- urement (observation vs questionnaire) and rater (trained observer vs parent/teacher) between self-initiations and general social-communicative skills may have compli- cated the possibility to find strong associations. Moreover, it is possible that the SRS scores may not reflect the col- lateral gains as mentioned in the underlying assumption of PRT. On the other hand, while previous studies mainly focused on self-initiations as a pivotal skill (Verschuur et al., 2014), other pivotal skills such as motivation, self- management, multiple cues and empathy are proposed (Koegel et al., 2016) but their relation to other, more general and untargeted skills has hardly been studied. In light of a variety of components that may be related to treatment efficacy (Fuller & Kaiser, 2019; Ospina et al., 2008; Rogers & Vismara, 2008), it is important to fur- ther study the underlying working mechanisms that con- tribute to the effectiveness of PRT and to optimize outcome measures. Furthermore, we only found associations between self- initiation change scores and parent-rated scales of the SRS, though not for the teacher-rated scales SRS. The fact that the majority of PRT sessions were focused on training parents (teachers were involved in only two sessions), may have resulted in lower generalizability of skills to the school setting. Although this study showed considerable strengths in design compared to earlier studies, some limitations should be considered. Our relatively high sample size still resulted in insufficient power to examine child, parent, and/or intervention-related modifiers of intervention efficacy. Moreover, we did not account for multiple testing in this subsample of an exploratory RCT, which may induce bias. Also, because we only included 3- to 8-year-old children with ASD, it is unclear whether the findings of this study on the additional value of robot-assistance generalize to other age groups. Besides, one may assume that the development of social self-initiations is associated with age since these types of self-initiations refer to early social-conversational skills. Furthermore, this study only incorporated the assess- ment of self-initiations during the intervention sessions, which limits insight in the generalization of self-initiations to other settings. In addition, only the SRS questionnaire rated by parents and teachers was used, to measure collateral gains of targeting self-initiations during PRT. Additional measurements of a broader range of child’s functioning are warranted to evaluate widespread improvements in chil- dren with ASD. Independent blinded assessments on col- lateral gains would further strengthen the validity of results. In the larger RCT from which the data for this study were drawn, additional blinded measurements were included (van den Berk-Smeekens et al., 2020). Parental fidelity of PRT implementation was low in our study, due to (1) the high emphasis of daily implementation of PRT techniques at home (not recorded on video for scoring), rather than intensively during a video-recorded 10-min parent-child interaction and (2) the use of a different (and more strin- gent) fidelity coding system, in which a correct sequence of PRT skills are highly emphasized (Verschuur et al., 2020). Although in both groups parental fidelity of PRT imple- mentation did not reach 80%, the fidelity rate in the robot- assisted PRT group was significant lower than in the PRT 2126 Autism 24(8) group. It could be that the manner of modelling of PRT techniques (i.e. directly by PRT therapist or via a robot) may have influence on parental fidelity of implementation. However, it is remarkable that despite of group differences in fidelity rate, largest treatment gains were observed in the robot-assisted PRT group. Different intervention manuals stress the importance of fidelity of implementation (Koegel & Koegel, 2006, 2012), but whether and how this modifies treatment effects should be subject of future study. In conclusion, our results suggest that robot assistance within an established intervention, namely PRT for ASD, may be a valuable treatment component, particularly when target- ing functional self-initiations. However, increases in self-initi- ations were not robustly associated with gains in more general social-communicative skills. These results highlight the importance of further investigation of possible components and working mechanisms that contribute to efficacy of PRT in optimizing both targeted and general social-communicative skills. While robot-assistance may serve as such a component, more rigorous studies are needed to further tailor interventions to individual needs of children with ASD.
