There were 25 papers out of 97 total papers (25.8%) that implemented emotion and expression recognition activities with robots as part of their interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The majority of these studies focused on teaching emotional recognition skills through various interactive exercises with social robots.

The emotion recognition activities generally fell into several categories. A significant number of studies utilized humanoid robots like NAO to display and teach facial expressions and emotional states (Miskam et al., 2013; Sandygulova et al., 2019; Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020). For instance, Tartarisco et al. (2022) implemented a group-based emotional skill training that included both emotion recognition tasks and context-emotion association exercises. Similarly, Costa et al. (2014) developed a game scenario where a humanoid robot displayed facial expressions and gestures representing different emotions for children to identify.

Several researchers incorporated emotion recognition into storytelling and interactive gameplay. Silva et al. (2023) used storytelling scenarios with a humanoid robot to facilitate emotion and facial expression recognition, while Scassellati et al. (2018) implemented emotion recognition exercises through a "Story game" using an in-home social robot. Some studies took a more technological approach, such as Li et al. (2020) and Alnajjar et al. (2021), who developed systems that included emotion and facial expression recognition tasks using robot display screens and advanced recognition algorithms.

The interventions often combined multiple modalities of emotional expression. For example, Tobar et al. (2021) focused on teaching gesture recognition alongside emotional expressions, while Brivio et al. (2021) utilized a soft, mobile autonomous robot for facial expression and emotion recognition activities. Some researchers, like Lemaignan et al. (2022), implemented mood reporting systems where children reported their emotional states before and after robot interactions, with the robot responding accordingly to help reinforce emotional awareness and recognition.

These studies collectively demonstrate the potential of using social robots as tools for teaching emotion recognition and expression skills to individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly those with autism spectrum disorder, through various interactive and engaging activities.
