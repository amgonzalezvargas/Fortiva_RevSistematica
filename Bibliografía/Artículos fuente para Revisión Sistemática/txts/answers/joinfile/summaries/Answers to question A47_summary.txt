There were 31 papers that reported using standardized assessment tools in their studies, while 65 papers did not employ such tools. The standardized assessment tools utilized across these studies can be categorized into several primary domains: autism-specific assessments, social-emotional evaluations, developmental scales, and learning assessments.

In the domain of autism-specific assessments, multiple studies employed well-established tools such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS/CARS2) (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Giannopulu, 2013; Marathaki et al., 2022), the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (Bharatharaj et al., 2017, 2016, 2018), and the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS-2) (Che Hamid et al., 2013; Miskam et al., 2013; Taheri et al., 2016, 2018, 2019). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) was also utilized in several studies (Boccanfuso et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2019; Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020).

For social-emotional assessment, researchers employed various standardized tools including the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (De Korte et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2023), the Test of Emotional Comprehension (TEC), and the Emotional Lexicon Test (ELT) (Marino et al., 2020; Tartarisco et al., 2022). The Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS) was specifically used to evaluate joint attention skills (Carlson et al., 2018; Kajopoulos et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2018).

Developmental and learning assessments included the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Boccanfuso et al., 2016), the Battelle Developmental Inventory (Cervera et al., n.d.), and the VB-MAPP assessment tool (Conti et al., 2020). Some studies incorporated specialized assessments for specific skills, such as the NEPSY-II visuo-motor precision subtest (Casellato et al., 2017) and Stambak's Rhythmic Structures Reproduction test (Taheri et al., 2016).

The implementation of these standardized assessment tools provided researchers with validated measures to evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions and ensure scientific rigor in their methodological approaches. This systematic use of standardized tools enables more reliable comparisons across studies and strengthens the evidence base for robot-assisted interventions in supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities.
