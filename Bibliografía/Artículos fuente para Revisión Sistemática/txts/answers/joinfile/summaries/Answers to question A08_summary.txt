There were 72 papers that focused on studying children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), representing approximately 75% of the total selected papers. The age ranges of the children studied varied considerably across the studies, spanning from as young as 1.65 years to 14 years old. The majority of studies concentrated on school-age children between 4-12 years old.

The research objectives were diverse, including the development of social skills (Scassellati, 2018; Abdelmohsen & Arafa, 2021; Valadao et al., 2016), joint attention skills (Carlson et al., 2018; Kajopoulos et al., 2015), communication abilities (Che Hamid et al., 2013; She & Ren, 2021), and emotional understanding (Marino et al., 2020). Several studies focused on specific therapeutic interventions, such as Pivotal Response Treatment (De Korte et al., 2020) and motor skills development (Subramani et al., 2017; Moorthy & Pugazhenthi, 2016).

The research methodologies employed various robotic platforms, including humanoid robots like NAO (Miskam et al., 2013), specialized therapeutic robots (Lebersfeld et al., 2018), and custom-designed platforms (Brivio et al., 2021). Many studies incorporated both individual and group-based interventions, with some implementing long-term, in-home interventions (Scassellati et al., 2018) while others focused on controlled laboratory settings.

The severity levels of ASD in the studied populations varied, with some studies specifically targeting children with high-functioning autism (Mavadati et al., 2014; Yin & Tung, 2013), while others included participants across the spectrum, including those with more severe manifestations (Sandygulova et al., 2019). This comprehensive coverage of different ASD severity levels demonstrates the field's effort to develop interventions suitable for diverse needs within the ASD population.
