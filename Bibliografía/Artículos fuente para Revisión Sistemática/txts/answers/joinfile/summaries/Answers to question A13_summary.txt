There were 6 papers out of the total 97 analyzed papers (6.2%) that focused on studying adults with other neurodevelopmental disabilities beyond Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These studies primarily investigated the application of robotic technologies for individuals with intellectual disabilities and other neurological conditions. 

The research approaches varied significantly across these studies. Pennington et al. (2014) conducted a focused investigation with three adults aged 19-21 with intellectual disabilities, specifically examining the use of robot-assisted instruction to enhance personal narrative skills in text messaging. In a broader educational context, Reardon et al. (2018) explored the educational benefits of robotic and augmented reality applications for college-age students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DDs). Silvera-Tawil et al. (2018) investigated verbal communication skills development in secondary school students aged 13-19 with intellectual disabilities through human-robot interaction.

Some studies adopted a more comprehensive approach. Zanatta et al. (2023) conducted a systematic review examining the effectiveness of robot-assisted therapy, either alone or in combination with virtual reality, for adults with various neurological conditions including stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Parkinson's disease. Lindsay (2020) investigated skill development through robotics programs for youth with disabilities, while Conti et al. (2020) explored the integration of humanoid robots in therapy settings for individuals with both intellectual disabilities and ASD.

These studies collectively demonstrate the diverse applications of robotic technologies in supporting adults with various neurodevelopmental disabilities, ranging from communication enhancement to therapeutic interventions and educational support. The research indicates a growing interest in leveraging technological solutions to address the specific needs of this population, although the relatively small number of studies (6.2%) suggests this remains an underexplored area requiring further investigation.
