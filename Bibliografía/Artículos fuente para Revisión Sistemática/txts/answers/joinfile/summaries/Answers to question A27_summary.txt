There were 63 papers that reported using humanoid robots in their studies, while 33 papers did not use humanoid robots. The most frequently used humanoid robot was NAO, appearing in 25 studies (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Cervera et al., n.d.; Charron et al., 2017; Conti et al., 2020; De Korte et al., 2020; Filiou, 2022; Che Hamid et al., 2013; Hamzah et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014, 2021; Marathaki et al., 2022; Marino et al., 2020; Mavadati et al., 2014; Miskam et al., 2013; Nie et al., 2018; Papadopoulou et al., 2022; Park & Kwon, 2016; Pennington et al., 2014; Pistoia et al., 2017; Qidwai et al., 2019; Sakka & Gaboriau, 2017; Sandygulova et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2023; She & Ren, 2021; Silvera-Tawil et al., 2018; Taheri et al., 2016, 2018, 2019; Talaei-Khoeli et al., 2017; Tuna, 2022; Welch et al., 2023; Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020; Simlesa et al., 2022).

Other humanoid robots used included KASPAR (Costa et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2017, 2019), Zeno (Bugnariu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020), ZECA (Costa et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2023), and Pepper (Lemaignan et al., 2022). Some studies used specialized humanoid robots like iCub (Chevalier et al., n.d.), CommU (Shimaya et al., 2016, 2019), QTrobot (Tartarisco et al., 2022), and DARwIn-OP (Peng et al., 2018). Additionally, some researchers developed custom humanoid robots like KERO (Tobar et al., 2021), TeoG (Brivio et al., 2021), and Jammo (Abdelmohsen & Arafa, 2021).

The humanoid robots were primarily used for social skills training, communication development, and therapeutic interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder and other intellectual disabilities. The robots' human-like features and programmable social behaviors made them particularly suitable for these applications.
