There were 69 papers that reported using commercially available robots, while 27 papers did not. The analysis reveals a strong preference for commercially available robots in research involving individuals with intellectual disabilities. The most frequently used commercial robot was the NAO humanoid robot by SoftBank Robotics (formerly Aldebaran Robotics), which was employed in 25 studies (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Cervera et al., n.d.; Charron et al., 2017; Conti et al., 2020; De Korte et al., 2020; among others). Other popular commercial robots included the KASPAR robot developed by the University of Hertfordshire (Costa et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2017, 2019), the Zeno/ZECA robot by Hanson Robotics (Bugnariu et al., 2013; Costa et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020), and various LEGO robotics platforms (Lindsay, 2020; Marzano et al., 2021; Zamin et al., 2019).

Several specialized educational and therapeutic robots were also utilized, such as the Bee-Bot educational robot (Chaldi & Mantzanidou, 2021; Pérez-Vazquez et al., 2022), the POL mobile toy robot (Giannopulu, 2013; Puyon & Giannopulu, 2013), and the iRobiQ robot by Yujin Robotics (Lee et al., 2013; Yun et al., 2014, 2016). Some studies employed robotic arms and manipulation platforms, including the OWI-535 Robotic Arm Edge kit (Moorthy & Pugazhenthi, 2017) and the Phantom Omni haptic device (Casellato et al., 2017).

The widespread use of commercially available robots suggests a preference for established, well-supported platforms that offer reliability and standardization in research settings. This trend also indicates the maturity of the commercial robotics market in providing solutions suitable for therapeutic and educational applications for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The predominance of humanoid robots, particularly the NAO platform, suggests that researchers value robots with human-like features and interactive capabilities for social skills development and therapeutic interventions.
