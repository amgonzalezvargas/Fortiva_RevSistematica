There were 30 papers that reported emotional improvements in participants through robot-assisted interventions, while 66 papers did not report such outcomes. The emotional improvements documented in these studies can be categorized into three main areas: enhanced emotion comprehension, improved emotion recognition, and increased positive emotions during interactions.

Several studies demonstrated significant improvements in emotion recognition capabilities. For instance, Lebersfeld et al. (2018) reported improved emotion identification accuracy across participant groups, while Marino et al. (2020) documented enhanced emotion comprehension and recognition through their robot-assisted social-emotional understanding intervention. Similarly, Tartarisco et al. (2022) observed improvements in both emotional comprehension and emotional language usage among participants.

Regarding positive emotional responses, multiple studies reported increased positive affect during robot interactions. Valadao et al. (2016) noted increased positive emotions and excitement in children with ASD during robot interactions, while Bharatharaj et al. (2017) documented increased happiness in children throughout their study period. Marzano et al. (2021) observed that autistic adolescents demonstrated increased positive emotions and empathy towards the robots.

The implementation of various interactive scenarios proved effective in facilitating emotional improvements. Costa et al. (2014) utilized a humanoid robot to help children recognize and label emotions, while Silva et al. (2023) employed storytelling scenarios to enhance emotion recognition. Some studies incorporated sophisticated measurement approaches, such as Tartarisco et al. (2022), who examined both behavioral and physiological interactions during emotional skill training.

Several longitudinal studies provided evidence of sustained emotional improvements. Scassellati et al. (2018) demonstrated improvements in emotion comprehension through long-term, in-home robot interactions. Additionally, studies like Lemaignan et al. (2022) reported self-reported mood improvements following robot interactions in educational settings.

These findings collectively suggest that robot-assisted interventions can effectively support emotional development across various domains, particularly in populations with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental conditions. The consistency of positive outcomes across multiple studies indicates the potential value of incorporating robotic technologies in therapeutic and educational interventions aimed at emotional skill development.
