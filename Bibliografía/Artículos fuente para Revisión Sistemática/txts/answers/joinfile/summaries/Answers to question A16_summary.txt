There were 36 papers that implemented imitation and movement activities with robots, while 60 papers did not include such activities in their interventions. This represents approximately 37.5% of the total analyzed papers incorporating movement-based interventions.

The implementation of imitation and movement activities typically involved various approaches. Several studies utilized humanoid robots, particularly the NAO robot, to demonstrate and guide physical movements for participants to replicate (Miskam et al., 2013; Marathaki et al., 2022). These activities ranged from basic gestures like waving and pointing to more complex sequences involving dance movements and coordinated actions (Lemaignan et al., 2022; Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020).

A significant number of studies focused on improving motor skills through structured imitation exercises. For instance, Moorthy & Pugazhenthi (2016) employed a Snatcher robot specifically designed to enhance psychomotor skills in autistic children through imitation-based training. Similarly, Subramani et al. (2017) developed a specialized robotic system for assessing and improving motor skills through shape-drawing tasks that evaluated upper limb motion and motor planning.

Several researchers incorporated musical elements into their movement-based interventions. Taheri et al. (2016, 2019) conducted studies where children imitated robots' movements while playing musical instruments, combining motor skill development with musical education. Peng et al. (2018) utilized a vibraphone with a humanoid robot to facilitate interaction training through musical play and movement.

The complexity of imitation activities varied across studies, from simple body awareness exercises (Costa et al., 2013) to more sophisticated interactive scenarios (Hamzah et al., 2014). Some researchers developed comprehensive systems incorporating multiple types of movement activities, such as Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018), who created a hybrid approach using multi-sensory stimulation rooms and robotic assistants to provide kinesthetic stimuli and movement activities.

The implementation of these activities was often structured within broader therapeutic frameworks, with researchers like Conti et al. (2020) integrating robotic-assisted movement activities into established therapy protocols for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability. This systematic integration of movement-based activities demonstrates the potential of robotic platforms to support motor skill development and social interaction through physical imitation exercises.
