There were 8 papers out of the total 97 analyzed papers (8.2%) that reported improvements in daily living skills through the use of robotic and AI technologies. The improvements encompassed various aspects of daily functioning and practical life skills.

Several studies focused on basic self-care and household management skills. Moorthy & Pugazhenthi (2017) documented improvements in fundamental daily living activities such as holding plates/tumblers and manipulating remote controls through their robotic training kit intervention. Similarly, Park & Kwon (2016) reported enhanced house cleaning abilities among participants. In a related study, Moorthy & Pugazhenthi (2016) found that children were able to generalize picking and placing skills learned through their Snatcher robot to everyday life situations.

Some research emphasized body awareness and personal development. Costa et al. (2013) noted improvements in body part identification skills, while Attawibulkul et al. (2019) implemented a daily routine game using the BLISS robot that enhanced personal-social development. Brivio et al. (2021) also reported general improvements in life skills through their soft, mobile autonomous robot intervention.

Social and vocational skills were addressed in several studies. Nanou et al. (2021) demonstrated improved teamwork participation abilities through inclusive educational robotics activities. Reardon et al. (2018) documented enhancements in both vocational and life skills through their combined robotic and augmented reality applications.

These findings suggest that robotic and AI technologies can effectively support the development of various daily living skills in individuals with intellectual disabilities, though it represents a relatively small portion of the total research examined in this review. The improvements span across personal care, household management, social interaction, and vocational domains, indicating the potential versatility of these technological interventions in supporting practical life skills development.
