There were 55 papers that incorporated visual sensors in their studies, while 41 papers did not utilize any visual sensing technology. The analysis reveals a significant trend in the implementation of various visual sensing technologies across different research applications.

The most commonly employed visual sensors were standard video cameras and webcams, which were utilized for multiple purposes including behavior monitoring, interaction recording, and analysis. For instance, studies like Valadao et al. (2016), Bharatharaj et al. (2017), and Boccanfuso et al. (2016) implemented video cameras primarily for recording and analyzing child-robot interactions. More sophisticated applications included the use of cameras for facial recognition, emotion detection, and gaze tracking, as demonstrated in studies by Brivio et al. (2021) and Kim et al. (2021).

Several studies incorporated specialized visual sensing equipment. The Microsoft Kinect sensor was frequently employed for motion and gesture recognition, as evidenced in research by Bonarini et al. (2014, 2016) and Taheri et al. (2019). Advanced robotic platforms like the NAO robot, which features built-in cameras, were utilized in multiple studies including Alnajjar et al. (2021) and Conti et al. (2020) for various visual processing tasks.

Eye tracking technologies were specifically implemented in studies focusing on gaze behavior and attention, such as Casellato et al. (2017) and Mavadati et al. (2014). Some researchers employed multiple visual sensing modalities simultaneously - for example, Bharatharaj et al. (2018) utilized both wireless cameras and USB cameras in their experimental setup.

RGB-D sensors and depth cameras were also prominent, particularly in studies requiring precise motion tracking or gesture recognition. Notable examples include the implementation of RealSense 3D cameras in Tartarisco et al. (2022) and the use of various depth sensors for interactive applications. The integration of these visual technologies demonstrates the field's progression toward more sophisticated and comprehensive monitoring and interaction capabilities in therapeutic and educational contexts for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
