There were 43 papers that focused on developing or evaluating cognitive skills in individuals with intellectual disabilities, while 53 papers did not address this aspect. The analysis reveals several key patterns in how robotic technologies are being utilized to enhance cognitive abilities.

A significant portion of the studies focused on attention-related skills, with multiple researchers implementing various approaches. For instance, Alnajjar et al. (2021) and Wanglavan et al. (2019) specifically developed methodologies for attention assessment and detection in children with ASD during robot interactions. Welch et al. (2023) advanced this further by incorporating physiological signals and machine learning algorithms to measure attentiveness during robot-assisted interventions.

Problem-solving and executive functions emerged as another prominent area of focus. Pérez-Vazquez et al. (2022) conducted a pilot study using the Bee-Bot robot to evaluate executive functions including planning, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control. Similarly, Sakka & Gaboriau (2017) developed cognitive skills through robot programming activities that required focus, planning, and problem-solving abilities.

Several studies integrated cognitive skill development within specific learning domains. For instance, Papadopoulou et al. (2022) evaluated cognitive skills related to academic performance, including reading speed and word production. Zamin et al. (2019) focused on attentiveness during language learning, while Shahriar et al. (2021) utilized the NAO robot to teach basic mathematical operations.

Multiple researchers employed multimodal approaches to cognitive development. Bonarini et al. (2014) promoted various cognitive functions simultaneously, including attention, body awareness, awareness of physical space, meaning construction, and imagination. Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018) developed a hybrid system incorporating multi-sensory stimulation rooms and robotic assistants to support cognitive intervention.

Music-based interventions were also utilized as a medium for cognitive development, as demonstrated by Taheri et al. (2016, 2019), who implemented music games to improve attention, working memory, and other cognitive skills through robot-assisted activities.

This comprehensive analysis indicates a strong trend toward using robotic technologies as tools for cognitive skill development, with approaches ranging from direct attention training to more complex executive function development through various interactive activities and games.
