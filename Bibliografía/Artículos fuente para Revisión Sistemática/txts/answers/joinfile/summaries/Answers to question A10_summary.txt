There were 13 papers out of 97 that included participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with varying age ranges from childhood through adulthood. Upon detailed analysis, several studies specifically focused on or included adults and older adolescents with ASD in their research populations. 

The studies involving adults or older adolescents with ASD included Conti et al. (2020), who incorporated adult participants with ASD in their therapeutic intervention study. Costa et al. (2014) included adolescent/adult participants aged 14 and 16 years with ASD in their emotion recognition research. Pennington et al. (2014) worked with older participants aged 19-21 years with intellectual disabilities. Silvera-Tawil et al. (2018) focused on secondary school students aged 13-19 years with autism, while Lemaignan et al. (2022) studied secondary school autistic pupils aged 12-16.

Other studies included younger participants or mixed age groups. For instance, Kim et al. (2021) included participants aged 6-16 years, and Taheri et al. (2018) worked with participants aged 6-15 years. Some studies focused exclusively on younger children, such as Charron et al. (2017) who worked with an 8-year-old participant, and Nanou et al. (2021) who studied 10-11 year old children with ASD Level 2.

Review papers like Santos et al. (2023) and Sartorato et al. (2017) included analyses of studies involving adults with ASD, providing broader perspectives on robotics applications across different age groups. This distribution of age ranges in the literature suggests a growing interest in studying the application of robotic technologies across the lifespan of individuals with ASD, though there remains a predominant focus on younger populations.
