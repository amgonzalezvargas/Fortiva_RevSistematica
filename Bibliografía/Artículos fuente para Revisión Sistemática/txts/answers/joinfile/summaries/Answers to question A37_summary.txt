There were 14 papers out of 97 that implemented Adaptive Learning Systems in their studies, representing approximately 14.4% of the total analyzed papers. The adaptive learning approaches included various methodologies such as difficulty adaptation algorithms, prompting hierarchies, and performance-based systems.

Several studies focused on implementing difficulty adaptation algorithms to personalize interactions. Scassellati (2018) and Scassellati et al. (2018) developed systems that modified difficulty levels based on children's performance during social skill development activities. Similarly, Alnajjar et al. (2021) created an automated methodology that personalized robot interventions according to individual attention scores. De Korte et al. (2020) and Marino et al. (2020) also incorporated difficulty adaptation algorithms in their robot-assisted interventions.

Prompting hierarchies were another common adaptive learning approach. Kim et al. (2014) implemented a least-to-most prompting hierarchy within their Pivotal Response Training framework. Reardon et al. (2018) comprehensively utilized multiple prompting strategies, including System of Least Prompts (SLP), System of Most Prompts (SMP), and Constant Time Delay (CTD). Tuna (2022) employed a hierarchy of prompts ranging from most to least moderate support. Nie et al. (2018) specifically developed a prompt hierarchy for joint attention tasks.

Some studies combined multiple adaptive learning strategies. Brivio et al. (2021) integrated both adaptive difficulty and prompting systems in their soft, mobile robot design. Charron et al. (2017) utilized prompting systems that adapted difficulty levels during joint attention skill development. Nanou et al. (2021) implemented the SAS strategy, which incorporated visual prompts and scaffolding techniques. Wanglavan et al. (2019) developed a system that adapted interactions based on detected attention levels, while Santos et al. (2023) provided a comprehensive review of various adaptive learning systems used across multiple studies.

These implementations demonstrate the versatility and importance of adaptive learning systems in supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly in robot-assisted interventions. The systems show a clear trend toward personalization and responsiveness to individual user needs and performance levels.
