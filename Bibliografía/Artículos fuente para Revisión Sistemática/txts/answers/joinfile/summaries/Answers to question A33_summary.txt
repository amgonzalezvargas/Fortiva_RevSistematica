In the analysis of physical feedback implementation across the reviewed studies, there were 6 papers out of the total 97 (6.2%) that incorporated physical feedback mechanisms such as haptic interfaces or force-feedback systems. The majority of studies (90 papers, 93.8%) did not utilize any form of physical feedback in their technological interventions.

Among the studies implementing physical feedback, various approaches and technologies were employed. Casellato et al. (2017) utilized a robotic manipulandum that provided haptic force feedback for motor execution assessment. Lemaignan et al. (2022) implemented physical interaction through the social robot Pepper, specifically incorporating hugging activities as a form of physical feedback. Sartorato et al. (2017) developed touch-reactive response systems to enhance sensory processing capabilities.

More sophisticated haptic implementations were observed in several studies. Silva et al. (2023) incorporated haptic feedback through an OPT device, while Subramani et al. (2017) implemented force feedback mechanisms using force-torque sensors in their robotic motor skills assessment system. Taheri et al. (2018) employed the Phantom Omni device as a haptic interface in their human-robot interaction study.

The implementation of physical feedback mechanisms appears to be particularly focused on motor skills development, sensory processing enhancement, and social interaction improvement. However, the relatively low number of studies incorporating physical feedback suggests this remains an underexplored area in technological interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
