There were 38 papers that focused on developing or evaluating language and speech skills, while 58 papers did not address these aspects. The analysis of these studies reveals a significant emphasis on various aspects of language and communication development through robotic interventions.

A substantial number of studies focused on verbal communication abilities through direct interaction with robots. For instance, Alnajjar et al. (2021), Brivio et al. (2021), and Che Hamid et al. (2013) implemented systems where robots facilitated two-way communication and verbal interactions. Several researchers specifically targeted speech production and articulation, as demonstrated in studies by Hong et al. (2022), who examined phonetic convergence, and Shah et al. (2023), who analyzed speech characteristics using metrics like Mean Length of Utterances (MLU) and Type-Token Ratio (TTR).

Language development was approached through various methodologies. Some studies, such as Bharatharaj et al. (2016) and Cervera et al. (n.d.), focused on fundamental language elements like teaching alphabets and semantic fields. Others, like Papadopoulou et al. (2022), addressed more complex language skills including reading decoding, phonological awareness, and reading comprehension. Pennington et al. (2014) specifically targeted written expression through text message composition.

Several researchers integrated language development with other therapeutic approaches. For example, Taheri et al. (2016, 2018, 2019) combined music-based activities with language development, while Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018) implemented multi-sensory stimulation rooms with robotic assistants to support language intervention. Some studies, such as She & Ren (2021), employed advanced technologies like deep learning to enhance the language interaction capabilities of humanoid robots.

The research also addressed specific populations and contexts. Zamin et al. (2019) focused on teaching Jawi letters and pronunciation, while Zhanatkyzy et al. (2020) specifically included children with Delayed Speech Development. These studies demonstrate the versatility of robotic interventions in addressing various aspects of language and speech development across different contexts and populations.
