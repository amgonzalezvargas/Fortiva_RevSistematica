There were 20 papers out of 96 total papers (20.8%) that reported improvements in motor and spatial skills through the use of robotic and AI technologies. The improvements documented encompassed various aspects of motor development, including hand-eye coordination, direction understanding, and geometric reasoning.

Several studies focused specifically on hand-eye coordination and motor imitation abilities. Casellato et al. (2017) demonstrated improvements in motor learning and hand-eye coordination in children with ASD, albeit at a slower rate compared to typically developing peers. Similarly, Moorthy & Pugazhenthi (2016, 2017) documented enhanced hand-eye coordination and direction understanding through their robotic training kit interventions. Taheri et al. (2019) also reported improvements in hand-eye coordination and motor skills through music-based robotic interventions.

In terms of spatial skills and geometric reasoning, Reardon et al. (2018) demonstrated improvements in geometric reasoning and object manipulation skills through robotic interventions. Bonarini et al. (2016) reported enhanced direction understanding through spatial activities with their mobile robot Teo. Brivio et al. (2021) documented improvements in both motor skills and spatial understanding using a soft, mobile autonomous robot.

Several studies focused on movement imitation and coordination. Bugnariu et al. (2013) developed quantitative methods to evaluate improvements in motor imitation skills using robotic systems. Sandygulova et al. (2019) and Yin & Tung (2013) both reported improvements in movement imitation abilities through robot-assisted therapy. Sartorato et al. (2017) documented enhanced coordination and movement abilities in their participants.

Some studies explored specialized applications, such as Taheri et al. (2016), which reported improvements in fine hand movements and rhythm perception through music-based robotic interventions. Tobar et al. (2021) demonstrated improvements in assembly skills and motor coordination using a portable robotic modular kit. The most comprehensive assessment came from Zanatta et al. (2023), who conducted a systematic review showing improvements in motor and functional outcomes related to both upper and lower limb impairment across neurological populations.
