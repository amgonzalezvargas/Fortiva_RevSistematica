In the analyzed literature, 12 out of 97 papers (12.37%) specifically focused on studying adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The research approaches varied significantly across these studies, encompassing different methodological frameworks and technological interventions.

Several studies implemented robotic interventions for therapeutic purposes. Bharatharaj et al. (2017) and Brivio et al. (2021) explored robot-assisted therapy for developing social and learning skills in adolescents with ASD. Similarly, Lebersfeld et al. (2018) investigated the application of a socially animated machine (SAM) robot for social skills intervention. Marzano et al. (2021) utilized programmable toy robots to enhance social communication skills in adolescents with severe autism.

Some researchers focused on specific aspects of human-robot interaction. Mavadati et al. (2014) conducted comparative analyses of gaze responses between adolescents with high-functioning autism and typically developed individuals during human-robot interactions. Shimaya et al. (2016, 2019) investigated the advantages of indirect conversation through desktop humanoid robots and tele-operated robots for daily life guidance and communication support.

Other studies concentrated on developing specialized interventions. Li et al. (2020) designed an accessible teacher-teleoperated robot system for minimally verbal autistic adolescents, while Wood et al. (2019) developed protocols for using humanoid robots to assist in developing visual perspective-taking skills. Sakka and Gaboriau (2017) explored a robotic 'Puppet Master' application for therapeutic support.

Additionally, two comprehensive reviews (Santos et al., 2023; Sartorato et al., 2017) analyzed various robotic applications for ASD intervention, including studies involving adolescents, highlighting the growing interest in this research area and its therapeutic potential.
