There were 37 papers that reported using commercially available software in their studies, while 59 papers did not mention the use of such software. The analysis reveals several predominant commercial software solutions utilized across these studies.

The most frequently employed commercial software was Choregraphe, a robot programming platform specifically designed for humanoid robots. This software was utilized in multiple studies (Conti et al., 2020; Che Hamid et al., 2013; Hamzah et al., 2014; Marathaki et al., 2022; Park & Kwon, 2016; Sakka & Gaboriau, 2017; Sandygulova et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2023; She & Ren, 2021; Silvera-Tawil et al., 2018; Taheri et al., 2016, 2018, 2019; Tuna, 2022; Shahriar et al., 2021).

Several studies implemented widely-used robotics frameworks and computer vision libraries. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was employed in multiple investigations (Reardon et al., 2018; Scassellati et al., 2018), while OpenCV was utilized for image processing tasks (Agel et al., 2020; Reardon et al., 2018). Some researchers opted for specialized software solutions such as AITalk for text-to-speech synthesis (Shimaya et al., 2016, 2019), and The Observer XT from Noldus for video analysis (Costa et al., 2014).

Various development environments and programming platforms were also utilized, including Unity 3D for virtual environment development (Abdelmohsen & Arafa, 2021), LabVIEW for robot control (Bugnariu et al., 2013; Subramani et al., 2017), and TiViPE for visual programming (Kim et al., 2014). Educational robotics platforms such as LEGO Mindstorms NXT programming software (Nanou et al., 2021) and Lego Boost software (Marzano et al., 2021) were also implemented in some studies.

The diversity of commercial software solutions employed reflects the varied requirements of different research objectives and the specific capabilities needed for different types of robot-assisted interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
