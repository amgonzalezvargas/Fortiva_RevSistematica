There were 83 papers that focused on developing or evaluating social communication skills in individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while 13 papers did not address this aspect. This represents a significant emphasis on social communication interventions in the literature, with approximately 86% of the reviewed studies targeting these skills.

The social communication skills targeted in these studies can be broadly categorized into several key areas. A substantial number of studies focused on fundamental social interaction skills such as eye contact and joint attention (Lee et al., 2013; Carlson et al., 2018; Kajopoulos et al., 2015). These skills are considered foundational for more complex social interactions. Many researchers employed humanoid robots like NAO (Miskam et al., 2013; She & Ren, 2021) and specialized platforms like KERO (Tobar et al., 2021) to facilitate these interactions.

Another significant area of focus was verbal and non-verbal communication skills. Studies such as Silvera-Tawil et al. (2018) and Talaei-Khoeli et al. (2017) specifically targeted verbal participation and spontaneous conversation. Non-verbal communication aspects were addressed through various approaches, including gesture recognition and teaching (Tobar et al., 2021) and emotional expression recognition (Costa et al., 2014).

Several studies implemented innovative approaches such as music-based interventions (Taheri et al., 2016, 2019) and storytelling games (Silva et al., 2023) to enhance social communication skills. These interventions often incorporated elements of turn-taking and social engagement, which are crucial aspects of successful social interaction.

The research methodologies varied significantly, from controlled laboratory studies to long-term in-home interventions (Scassellati et al., 2018). Many studies utilized quantitative measurements of engagement and interaction quality (Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020), while others employed more qualitative approaches to assess improvements in social communication abilities.

It is noteworthy that many studies adopted a comprehensive approach, targeting multiple aspects of social communication simultaneously. For instance, Marathaki et al. (2022) focused on improving eye contact, attention, and imitation skills through integrated robot-assisted interventions. This holistic approach reflects the understanding that social communication skills are interconnected and often develop in parallel.
