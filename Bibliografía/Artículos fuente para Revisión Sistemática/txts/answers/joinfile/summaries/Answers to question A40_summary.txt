In analyzing the social interaction improvements reported across the reviewed studies, there were 72 papers that documented positive outcomes in this domain, while 24 papers did not report such improvements. The findings demonstrate a significant trend in the effectiveness of robotic interventions for enhancing social interaction capabilities in individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The reported improvements manifested across several key social interaction domains. A substantial number of studies (Scassellati, 2018; Valadao et al., 2016; Alnajjar et al., 2021) documented increased eye contact and more frequent social interactions. Joint attention skills, which are fundamental to social development, showed notable enhancement in multiple studies (Carlson et al., 2018; Kajopoulos et al., 2015; Wood et al., 2019). The research by Charron et al. (2017) specifically demonstrated improvements in both joint attention and social engagement through systematic robotic interventions.

Enhanced social engagement was consistently reported across numerous studies. For instance, Bharatharaj et al. (2018) observed increased social engagement behaviors when children interacted with robots compared to human interactions. Similarly, Brivio et al. (2021) and Bonarini et al. (2016) documented increased social engagement and extended interaction times with robotic platforms. The research conducted by Conti et al. (2020) specifically noted improvements in imitation behaviors, which are crucial for social skill development.

Several studies focused on measuring interaction duration as a metric for social improvement. Giannopulu (2013) and De Korte et al. (2020) reported increased interaction times during robot-assisted interventions compared to baseline measurements. This extended engagement suggests enhanced social interest and reduced social anxiety, which are significant challenges for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The improvements in social behaviors were also documented in various contexts. Lebersfeld et al. (2018) reported enhancements in parent-rated social skills, while Lemaignan et al. (2022) observed increased social interactions between students who typically would not interact. These findings suggest that robotic interventions can facilitate social skill development across different environmental settings and relationship dynamics.

It is noteworthy that several studies (Marzano et al., 2021; Pliasa & Fachantidis, 2021) reported improvements not only in human-robot interactions but also in subsequent human-human interactions, indicating potential generalization of acquired social skills. This transfer of skills from robot-mediated interactions to human social contexts represents a particularly valuable outcome for therapeutic interventions.
