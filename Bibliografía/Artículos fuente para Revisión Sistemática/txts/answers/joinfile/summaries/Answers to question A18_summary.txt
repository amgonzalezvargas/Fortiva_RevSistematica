In the analyzed literature, there were 20 papers out of 96 total papers (20.8%) that incorporated music and rhythm activities with robots as part of their interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. These activities encompassed various forms of musical engagement, including singing, dancing, instrument playing, and rhythm-based exercises.

Several studies utilized humanoid robots, particularly the NAO robot, for music-based interventions. For instance, Che Hamid et al. (2013), Miskam et al. (2013), and Hamzah et al. (2014) implemented modules where NAO played songs and performed related actions. More specialized musical applications were explored by Peng et al. (2018), who incorporated a vibraphone for interaction training, and Taheri et al. (2016), who included both xylophone and drum activities in their robotic interventions.

The musical activities served various therapeutic and educational purposes. Some studies, such as Bharatharaj et al. (2018) and Brivio et al. (2021), used music-based interventions to enhance social engagement. Others, like Marathaki et al. (2022) and Sandygulova et al. (2019), implemented dance and song activities to develop symbolic play and imitation skills. The integration of music often included multimodal elements, as demonstrated by Qidwai and Shakir (2013) and Qidwai et al. (2019), who combined dance routines with built-in music and singing activities.

Several researchers focused on using music as a reinforcement strategy or engagement tool. Yun et al. (2016) incorporated children's songs with arm movements to facilitate eye contact and emotion reading, while Lemaignan et al. (2022) emphasized the use of calm music and dance activities in a school setting. Some studies, such as Soleiman et al. (2014), integrated music playback capabilities into their robotic platforms to enhance human-robot interaction.

The implementation of these musical activities varied in complexity and purpose across studies, ranging from simple song playback (Alnajjar et al., 2021) to more structured musical instruction (Taheri et al., 2019). This diversity in approaches reflects the versatility of music-based interventions in robotic applications for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
