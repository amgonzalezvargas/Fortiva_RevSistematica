There were 30 papers that reported using custom developed robots, while 66 papers did not use custom robots in their studies. The custom robots varied significantly in their design, functionality, and intended therapeutic purposes.

Several studies focused on developing specialized therapeutic robots. Bharatharaj et al. (2017, 2016, 2018) created KiliRo, a parrot-inspired therapeutic robot designed to improve learning and social interaction in children with autism. Similarly, Soleiman et al. (2014) developed RoboParrot, another parrot-like robot modified from a toy. Brivio et al. (2021) introduced TeoG, a soft mobile autonomous robot, while Bonarini et al. (2016) developed Teo, a mobile robot specifically designed for children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

Some researchers created humanoid or anthropomorphic platforms. Shimaya et al. (2016, 2019) utilized CommU, a custom desktop humanoid robot standing 304mm tall with 14 degrees of freedom. Hossain et al. (2020) developed their own humanoid robot, while Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018) created an anthropomorphic robot using a 3D printed skeleton and servo motors.

Several studies focused on modular or adaptable robotic platforms. Tobar et al. (2021) developed both the KERO playable robotic platform and a portable modular kit with interchangeable parts. Moorthy & Pugazhenthi (2017) modified a commercial robotic arm by reducing degrees of freedom and customizing the control interface. Some researchers utilized modified commercial platforms, such as Zamin et al. (2019) who developed Jawi Alphabot using LEGO EV3 with custom functionality.

Mobile robots were also prevalent in the custom developments. Valadao et al. (2016) created MARIA, a mobile robot, while Binotte et al. (2017) developed N-MARIA using a Pioneer robot base with additional components. Wanglavan et al. (2019) developed the BLISS robot, a mobile robot with a toy-like appearance, and Giannopulu (2013) created mobile toy robots called GIPY 1 and POL.

These custom developments demonstrate the diverse approaches researchers have taken to create specialized robotic platforms tailored to the specific needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly focusing on social interaction, learning, and therapeutic applications.
