In the analysis of resource limitations across the reviewed studies, there were 5 papers out of 97 that explicitly reported resource-related constraints, representing approximately 5.2% of the total sample. The identified limitations primarily centered around financial constraints and accessibility barriers.

The most frequently cited resource limitation was the high cost associated with robotic technologies. Pennington et al. (2014) and Yin & Tung (2013) specifically highlighted the substantial financial investment required for robot acquisition and manufacturing. Similarly, Sartorato et al. (2017) emphasized both the high costs and limited accessibility as significant barriers to implementation. In their comprehensive scoping review, Santos et al. (2023) identified cost-related challenges as a recurring theme across multiple studies involving robotics for Autism Spectrum Disorder interventions. Resource constraints in implementation were also noted by Brivio et al. (2021) in their work with soft, mobile autonomous robots.

These findings suggest that while technological solutions show promise for enhancing autonomy in individuals with intellectual disabilities, their widespread adoption may be hindered by economic factors. The relatively low percentage of studies reporting resource limitations (5.2%) might not fully reflect the actual scope of this challenge, as studies that could not proceed due to resource constraints would not have been published and thus not included in this review. This underscores the need for more cost-effective solutions and increased funding support to make these technologies more accessible to a broader population of potential users.
