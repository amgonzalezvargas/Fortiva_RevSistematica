There were 44 papers that incorporated stakeholder feedback methods in their research methodology, while 52 papers did not include such methods. This indicates that approximately 46% of the analyzed studies utilized various forms of stakeholder input to evaluate their interventions and outcomes.

The stakeholder feedback was primarily collected through several methodological approaches. A significant number of studies incorporated parent/caregiver feedback through surveys and questionnaires (Scassellati, 2018; Abdelmohsen & Arafa, 2021; Attawibulkul et al., 2019). These assessments were often used to evaluate improvements in social skills, personal development, and overall intervention effectiveness. Professional clinical feedback was also prominently featured, with many studies gathering input from therapists, psychologists, and medical professionals (Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Bonarini et al., 2016; Conti et al., 2020). This clinical feedback provided valuable insights into the therapeutic validity and effectiveness of the interventions.

Educational stakeholder feedback was another significant component, with numerous studies collecting data from teachers and special education professionals (Costa et al., 2013; Hamzah et al., 2014; Lemaignan et al., 2022). These educators provided crucial perspectives on the educational appropriateness and effectiveness of the interventions within classroom settings. Some studies employed a comprehensive multi-stakeholder approach, gathering feedback from multiple sources including parents, clinicians, and educators simultaneously (Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Charron et al., 2017; De Korte et al., 2020).

The feedback collection methods varied across studies, including structured interviews (Sandygulova et al., 2019), satisfaction questionnaires (Papadopoulou et al., 2022), observational assessments (Shimaya et al., 2016), and standardized evaluation forms. This diverse approach to stakeholder feedback collection helped provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interventions' effectiveness and impact across different contexts and perspectives.
