In the analysis of interaction limitations across the reviewed studies, there were 15 papers out of 97 that explicitly reported various interaction-related challenges and limitations in their robotic interventions, representing approximately 15.5% of the total studies. These limitations encompassed several key areas that affected the effectiveness and naturality of human-robot interactions.

The most frequently reported limitation was the restricted complexity of robot interactions, as noted in multiple studies (Brivio et al., 2021; Lemaignan et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2023; Scassellati et al., 2018). This limitation often manifested as simplified or constrained interaction patterns that failed to capture the complexity of natural human interactions. Several researchers, including Alnajjar et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2020), specifically highlighted limitations in the robots' ability to adapt spontaneously to unexpected situations or user behaviors.

Another significant challenge identified was the difficulty in generalizing learned behaviors to real-world situations, as reported by Taheri et al. (2019) and Sartorato et al. (2017). This limitation suggests a gap between controlled experimental environments and practical applications. Some studies also reported specific technical constraints, such as Soleiman et al. (2014) noting physical interaction limitations due to robot containment requirements, and Reardon et al. (2018) identifying difficulties in maintaining user attention and detecting idle states.

The ability to provide appropriate feedback was another area of concern, with Pennington et al. (2014) specifically noting limitations in the robot's capacity to offer detailed feedback on participant responses. Studies by Kim et al. (2014) and Sandygulova et al. (2019) reported challenges related to the robots' handling of unexpected responses and their overall adaptability in interactive scenarios.

These findings suggest that while robotic interventions show promise, significant technological and design challenges remain in creating truly adaptive and naturalistic human-robot interactions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The limitations identified point to important areas for future research and development in the field of assistive robotics.
