There were 13 papers out of 97 that focused on developing or evaluating self-management and adaptive skills in individuals with intellectual disabilities, representing approximately 13.4% of the total analyzed studies. The research in this domain encompassed various aspects of self-management and adaptive behaviors, ranging from basic daily living activities to more complex self-regulatory skills.

Several studies concentrated on fundamental daily living skills. Attawibulkul et al. (2019) developed interventions using the BLISS robot to support daily routines such as brushing teeth, bathing, eating, and organizing school materials. Similarly, Park and Kwon (2016) specifically targeted house cleaning skills using robotic instructors for children with cognitive disabilities. Moorthy and Pugazhenthi (2017) employed a robotic training kit to develop adaptive skills for daily living activities.

Body awareness and self-regulation emerged as another significant focus area. Costa et al. (2013) utilized a humanoid robot to enhance body awareness skills in children with autism. Sakka and Gaboriau (2017) implemented robot-mediated interactions to facilitate self-awareness and self-regulation development. Brivio et al. (2021) and Filiou (2022) both employed robots to improve adaptive behaviors and self-regulatory capabilities.

Some researchers explored broader adaptive skill development through various interactive approaches. Bonarini et al. (2014, 2016) investigated the development of adaptive behaviors and practical skills through playful interactions with mobile robots. Lemaignan et al. (2022) utilized the Pepper robot as a teaching aid to support self-regulation and adaptive behaviors through calming activities and emotional regulation exercises.

The development of social and organizational skills was also addressed. Nanou et al. (2021) implemented the SAS strategy to enhance teamwork participation skills, while Lindsay (2020) evaluated outcomes related to time management and self-confidence. Reardon et al. (2018) took a comprehensive approach, focusing on life skills and vocational training to promote independence across personal, community, and occupational domains.

These studies collectively demonstrate the potential of robotic technologies in supporting the development of self-management and adaptive skills in individuals with intellectual disabilities, though they represent a relatively small portion of the total research examined in this review.
