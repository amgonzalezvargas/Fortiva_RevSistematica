There were 37 papers that reported using display interfaces such as touchscreens, interactive displays, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs), while 59 papers did not incorporate such interfaces in their studies. This represents approximately 38.5% of the total analyzed papers implementing some form of display interface technology.

The display interfaces utilized can be categorized into several main types. Touchscreen interfaces, particularly through tablets and mobile devices, were prominently featured in multiple studies (Brivio et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020; Marino et al., 2020; Pliasa & Fachantidis, 2021). These touchscreens were employed both for direct interaction with users and as control interfaces for therapists or operators. Desktop and larger display systems were also common, with studies like Abdelmohsen & Arafa (2021) and Subramani et al. (2017) utilizing desktop computer displays and full HD screens respectively.

Several robotic platforms incorporated built-in display interfaces. For instance, the BLISS robot version 3 featured an interactive touch screen for displaying facial expressions and facilitating games (Attawibulkul et al., 2019), while QTrobot included a screen for presenting animated faces (Tartarisco et al., 2022). Some studies implemented more complex display configurations, such as Park & Kwon (2016) who utilized a desktop computer connected to a VIM projector.

The purposes of these interfaces varied significantly across studies. They were used for displaying visual stimuli (Carlson et al., 2018), providing color feedback (Lee et al., 2014), enabling robot control through graphical interfaces (Silvera-Tawil et al., 2018), and facilitating educational games (Tobar et al., 2021). Several studies also employed display interfaces as part of comprehensive systems combining multiple interaction modalities, demonstrating the versatility of these technologies in supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities.

This analysis reveals that display interfaces are widely integrated into assistive technologies, serving various functions from direct user interaction to system control and feedback presentation. The significant proportion of studies incorporating these interfaces suggests their importance in creating accessible and engaging interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
