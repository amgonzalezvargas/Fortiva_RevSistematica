There were 83 papers that used direct observation methods to gather results, while 13 papers did not employ such methods. This indicates that direct observation was the predominant methodology used across the reviewed studies, representing approximately 86.5% of the total papers analyzed.

The direct observation methods employed can be categorized into several main approaches. Video recording analysis was the most commonly used method, with a significant number of studies utilizing video footage to analyze interactions, behaviors, and responses. Many researchers employed specialized software like ELAN for detailed video analysis (Puyon & Giannopulu, 2013; Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020). Audio recording analysis was also utilized, particularly in studies focusing on verbal communication and speech patterns (Hong et al., 2022).

Observational data collection through structured protocols was another prominent method, with researchers using observation sheets, trial-by-trial data collection forms, and category systems to measure specific behaviors or skills (Chaldi & Mantzanidou, 2021; Pérez-Vazquez et al., 2022). Some studies employed multiple camera angles to ensure comprehensive data collection (Silva et al., 2023), while others combined observational methods with quantitative measurements such as interaction logs or performance metrics (Subramani et al., 2017).

Several studies incorporated specialized data collection approaches, including focus groups and interviews (Silvera-Tawil et al., 2018), position and force data analysis from robotic systems (Subramani et al., 2017), and behavioral observation protocols specifically designed for autism intervention research. The combination of multiple observation methods within single studies was common, suggesting a trend toward comprehensive data collection approaches that capture both qualitative and quantitative aspects of participant behavior and interaction.

This widespread use of direct observation methods highlights the importance of detailed, systematic observation in evaluating the effectiveness of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly in understanding complex social interactions and behavioral responses that may not be captured through other assessment methods.
