In the systematic review, there were 13 papers out of 96 total papers (13.5%) that incorporated machine learning applications in their methodologies. The implementation of machine learning techniques varied across studies, ranging from computer vision algorithms to physiological data analysis.

Several studies focused on behavioral and interaction analysis. Wanglavan et al. (2019) employed multiple classification algorithms including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forest classifiers for attention detection in robot-assisted autism therapy. Similarly, Welch et al. (2023) utilized various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees to analyze physiological signals for measuring attentiveness during social skills interventions. Nie et al. (2018) implemented support vector machines to analyze joint attention performance in human-robot interactions.

In the domain of computer vision and recognition systems, multiple studies incorporated specialized algorithms. Yun et al. (2016) implemented Haar-cascade classifiers for face detection, while Bharatharaj et al. (2016) utilized face recognition techniques. Agel et al.
