There were 12 papers out of 97 that focused on studying children with other neurodevelopmental disabilities beyond Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The studies encompassed a diverse range of conditions including intellectual disabilities, specific learning disorders, cognitive disabilities, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and delayed speech development.

Several studies investigated multiple conditions simultaneously. For instance, Attawibulkul et al. (2019) and Brivio et al. (2021) included children with various special needs alongside those with ASD in their research. Bonarini and colleagues conducted two significant studies (2014, 2016) specifically focusing on children with intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Papadopoulou et al. (2022) concentrated specifically on elementary school children with specific learning disorders, while Park & Kwon (2016) targeted children with cognitive disabilities.

A notable subset of studies examined ADHD either exclusively or in combination with other conditions. Sandygulova et al. (2019) and Zhanatkyzy et al. (2020) included children with ADHD in their research, with the latter also incorporating subjects with delayed speech development. Some studies, such as Yun et al. (2014), included non-ASD children as control groups to provide comparative data for their research outcomes.

The research methodologies varied from case studies (Casellato et al., 2017; Chaldi & Mantzanidou, 2021) to broader investigations involving multiple participants with different conditions. This diversity in study populations and methodological approaches provides a comprehensive understanding of how robotic interventions can benefit children with various neurodevelopmental disabilities beyond ASD.
