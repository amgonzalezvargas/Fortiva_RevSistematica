There were 58 papers that implemented communication and language activities with robots, while 38 papers did not include such activities. This represents approximately 60% of the analyzed papers focusing on communication-based interventions.

The communication and language activities implemented across these studies can be categorized into several main approaches. A significant number of studies utilized verbal interaction protocols, where robots engaged in direct conversation with participants through greetings, questions, and responses (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Agel et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2020). Joint attention tasks were frequently implemented, with robots directing participants' attention to specific objects or activities (Brivio et al., 2021; Carlson et al., 2018; Charron et al., 2017).

Several studies incorporated structured language learning activities, including alphabets, numbers, and phonological awareness exercises (Bharatharaj et al., 2016; Papadopoulou et al., 2022). Digital communication interfaces were also utilized, with some studies implementing tablet-based interactions or text message composition training (Li et al., 2020; Pennington et al., 2014). More specialized approaches included music-based communication activities (Taheri et al., 2016, 2019) and cultural-specific language instruction, such as Jawi letter teaching (Zamin et al., 2019).

The communication protocols often integrated multiple modalities, combining verbal interactions with visual supports, gestures, and interactive interfaces (Robles-Bykbaev et al., 2018). Some studies focused on specific communication skills like listener responding (Chaldi & Mantzanidou, 2021) or personal narrative development (Pennington et al., 2014). The interventions were frequently designed to progress from basic communication tasks to more complex social interactions, adapting to the participants' skill levels and developmental needs.

Recent studies have begun incorporating advanced technologies such as voice recognition and machine learning algorithms to enhance the communication experience (She & Ren, 2021; Welch et al., 2023). These technological developments have enabled more sophisticated and responsive communication interactions between robots and participants with intellectual disabilities.
