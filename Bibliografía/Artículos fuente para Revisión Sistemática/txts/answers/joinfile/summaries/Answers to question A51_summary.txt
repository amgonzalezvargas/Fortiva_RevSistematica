There were 73 papers that reported methodological limitations in their studies, while 23 papers did not report any limitations. The analysis of these limitations reveals several common methodological challenges in research involving robotics and individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The most frequently reported limitation was small sample size, which was mentioned in a substantial majority of the studies (e.g., Valadao et al., 2016; Alnajjar et al., 2021; Attawibulkul et al., 2019). Some studies had particularly small samples, with several including as few as 1-2 participants (Casellato et al., 2017; Chaldi & Mantzanidou, 2021; Kim et al., 2014). This limitation significantly impacts the statistical power and generalizability of findings.

Limited intervention duration and lack of long-term follow-up were also commonly cited limitations (Bharatharaj et al., 2016; Marathaki et al., 2022). For instance, some studies were conducted over very short periods, such as just 5 days (Bharatharaj et al., 2016), which may not be sufficient to observe meaningful behavioral changes or establish the sustainability of improvements.

The absence of control groups was another significant methodological limitation reported by several researchers (Charron et al., 2017; Conti et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2013). This absence makes it difficult to definitively attribute observed improvements to the robotic interventions rather than other factors.

Several studies also noted limitations regarding the generalizability of their findings (Brivio et al., 2021; De Korte et al., 2020), often due to participant characteristics or specific contextual factors. For example, some studies primarily included high-functioning participants (Chevalier et al., n.d.), limiting the applicability of findings to individuals with different levels of functioning.

The heterogeneity in assessment methods and intervention protocols was highlighted as a limitation in some studies (Zanatta et al., 2023), making it difficult to compare results across different research efforts. Additionally, some researchers noted challenges in accurately measuring social skills and potential assessment bias (Zhanatkyzy et al., 2020).

These methodological limitations highlight the need for larger, more rigorous studies with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods to better understand the effectiveness of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
