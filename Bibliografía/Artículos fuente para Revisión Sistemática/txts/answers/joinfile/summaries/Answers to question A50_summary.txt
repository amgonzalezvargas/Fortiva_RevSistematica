There were 43 papers that reported using statistical analysis in their methodology, while 53 papers did not include statistical analysis in their results. This indicates that approximately 45% of the reviewed studies incorporated quantitative statistical methods to evaluate their findings.

The statistical methods employed varied considerably across studies, with several papers utilizing multiple analytical approaches. The most commonly used statistical tests included t-tests (both paired and independent samples), ANOVA, and non-parametric tests such as Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. For instance, Papadopoulou et al. (2022) employed both Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, while Hong et al. (2022) utilized linear mixed effect models and repeated measures ANOVA.

Several studies implemented more sophisticated statistical approaches, such as linear mixed-effects models (De Korte et al., 2020) and leave-one-out cross-validation (Kim et al., 2021). Some researchers also employed correlation analyses, with Giannopulu (2013) utilizing Spearman's correlation coefficient to analyze relationships between variables. Classification accuracy metrics were reported in studies focusing on machine learning applications, such as Wanglavan et al. (2019) and Welch et al. (2023), who used AUC and F1-scores.

The statistical analyses were primarily used to evaluate intervention effectiveness, compare pre-post intervention outcomes, analyze behavioral changes, and assess the reliability of technological implementations. For example, Boccanfuso et al. (2016) used correlations and linear mixed models to examine play patterns and affective responses, while Silva et al. (2023) employed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to evaluate improvements in social communication.

It is worth noting that the complexity and sophistication of statistical analyses varied significantly across studies, ranging from basic descriptive statistics to more complex multivariate analyses. This variation reflects the diverse nature of the research objectives and experimental designs within the field of robotics and artificial intelligence applications for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
