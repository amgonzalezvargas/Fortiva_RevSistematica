There were 2 papers out of the total 97 analyzed papers (2.1%) that reported the use of immersive interfaces such as Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) in their studies. The majority of papers (94 papers, representing 97.9%) did not implement immersive interface technologies.

Among the studies that utilized immersive interfaces, Reardon et al. (2018) implemented AR interfaces through Google Glass in their research on educational applications for students with intellectual disabilities. The second study by Zanatta et al. (2023) examined the integration of virtual reality interfaces in combination with robot-assisted therapy, specifically analyzing their impact on health-related quality of life in neurological patients.

The limited number of studies utilizing immersive interfaces suggests that this is an emerging area within the field of assistive technologies for individuals with intellectual disabilities. This relatively low adoption rate of VR and AR technologies may be attributed to various factors such as implementation complexity, cost considerations, or the need for further research on their effectiveness in this specific population. The findings indicate a potential opportunity for future research to explore the benefits and applications of immersive interfaces in supporting adults with intellectual disabilities.
