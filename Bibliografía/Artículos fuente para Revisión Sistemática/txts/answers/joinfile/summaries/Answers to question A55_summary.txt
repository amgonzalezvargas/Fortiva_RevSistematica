In the systematic review, there were 16 papers out of 97 that explicitly reported research design limitations, representing approximately 16.5% of the total analyzed papers. The reported limitations encompassed various methodological challenges that potentially impacted the robustness and generalizability of the findings.

Several studies highlighted limitations related to experimental settings and methodology. Alnajjar et al. (2021) and Kim et al. (2021) specifically noted concerns regarding artificial experimental settings that might not fully reflect real-world conditions. Chevalier et al. (n.d.) identified limitations in their screen-based robot interaction approach, which may have affected ecological validity. The focus on tool development rather than comprehensive outcome assessment was a recurring limitation, as noted by Charron et al. (2017), Costa et al. (2014), and Sandygulova et al. (2019).

Some researchers acknowledged limitations in understanding intervention mechanisms. De Korte et al. (2020) and Marzano et al. (2021) explicitly mentioned the need for better comprehension of how their interventions functioned. Talaei-Khoeli et al. (2017) noted insufficient depth in examining socio-economic factors and external activities' influence on performance outcomes. Wood et al. (2019) identified issues with participant selection criteria, while Yun et al. (2016) raised concerns about participants' ability to interact with robots independently of therapist assistance.

In terms of assessment limitations, several studies (Sartorato et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2023; Zanatta et al., 2023) emphasized the need for more comprehensive outcome evaluations and targeted investigations of specific quality of life components. Reardon et al. (2018) specifically acknowledged limitations in prompt design and interaction modalities, which could have influenced the effectiveness of their robotic interventions.

These identified limitations underscore the importance of developing more robust research methodologies in future studies, particularly focusing on real-world applications, comprehensive outcome assessments, and better understanding of intervention mechanisms in the context of robotics and artificial intelligence applications for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
