In the analysis of the selected studies, 6 out of 96 papers (6.25%) incorporated physiological measurements in their research methodologies. The implementation of these measurements varied across studies, encompassing different physiological parameters and measurement techniques.

Several distinct approaches to physiological monitoring were identified. Tartarisco et al. (2022) and Welch et al. (2023) focused on cardiovascular measurements, specifically utilizing heart rate variability monitoring to assess participant responses during robot-assisted interventions. In terms of biomechanical measurements, Subramani et al. (2017) employed force measurements and motion capture analysis to evaluate motor skills in children with autism. Boccanfuso et al. (2016) utilized accelerometer and gyroscope data from the robot to quantify interaction patterns. Kim et al. (2021) implemented EMG sensors for measuring physiological responses during therapeutic interactions. Santos et al. (2023), in their scoping review, documented various physiological measurement approaches, including heart rate monitoring, that have been employed in robotics applications for autism spectrum disorder.

The integration of these physiological measurements represents a methodologically rigorous approach to quantifying participant responses and interactions in robot-assisted interventions. These measurements provide objective data that complement observational and qualitative assessments, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
