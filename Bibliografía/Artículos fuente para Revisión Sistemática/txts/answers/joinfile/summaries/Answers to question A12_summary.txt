There were 3 papers out of 96 total papers that focused on studying adolescents with other neurodevelopmental disabilities beyond autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This represents approximately 3.1% of the analyzed papers, indicating this is a relatively understudied population in the context of robotic and AI interventions.

The studies that included adolescents with other neurodevelopmental disabilities were conducted by Brivio et al. (2021), Park & Kwon (2016), and Wood et al. (2019). Park & Kwon (2016) specifically focused on adolescents aged 10-18 with cognitive disabilities, implementing robotic instructors as educational tools. Wood et al. (2019) included a participant with global developmental delay with ASD traits in their study examining visual perspective taking skills development using humanoid robots. Similarly, Brivio et al. (2021) incorporated adolescents with various neurodevelopmental conditions beyond ASD in their investigation of skill development through robotic play-based interventions.

This limited representation of studies focusing on adolescents with other neurodevelopmental disabilities suggests a significant gap in the literature. The predominant focus on ASD in the reviewed papers indicates a need for more diverse research addressing the technological needs of adolescents with other types of neurodevelopmental conditions.
