In the systematic review, there were 18 papers out of 96 that reported implementation limitations in their studies, representing approximately 19% of the total analyzed papers. These limitations encompassed various aspects that affected the deployment and effectiveness of the technological interventions.

The most frequently reported implementation challenges were related to limited replicability and setting-specific constraints. Several studies, including Alnajjar et al. (2021), Marzano et al. (2021), and Santos et al. (2023), specifically highlighted difficulties in replicating their interventions across different contexts. Setting-specific constraints were particularly emphasized in studies by Brivio et al. (2021) and Costa et al. (2014), who noted that the experimental setup and room configuration significantly influenced the intervention's effectiveness.

Technical limitations regarding device operation and system reliability were also prominent. Simlesa et al. (2022) reported inconsistent device operation, while Pistoia et al. (2017) noted that parents experienced difficulties operating the system independently without professional assistance. The integration of complex technologies often presented challenges in maintaining consistent functionality, as documented by Wood et al. (2019), who reported difficulties in maintaining consistent progression criteria due to varied participant abilities.

Adaptability limitations were another significant concern. Scassellati et al. (2018) and Zanatta et al. (2023) specifically mentioned limited adaptability to diverse needs as a key implementation challenge. This limitation was particularly relevant in educational settings, where Lemaignan et al. (2022) emphasized the importance of considering robots as teaching aids while acknowledging their implementation constraints.

Resource-dependent implementation was also identified as a limiting factor. Studies by Kim et al. (2014) and Reardon et al. (2018) highlighted the need for specific resources and improvements in interaction fluency and instruction detail. These resource requirements often posed challenges for widespread implementation, particularly in settings with limited access to technical support or specialized equipment.
