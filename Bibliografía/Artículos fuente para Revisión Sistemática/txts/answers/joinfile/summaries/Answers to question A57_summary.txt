In the systematic review, there were 23 papers that reported assessment limitations, while 73 papers did not mention any assessment-related constraints. The identified limitations predominantly focused on challenges in measuring complex social interactions and difficulties in capturing behavioral nuances during robot-assisted interventions.

Several studies highlighted specific assessment challenges in the context of robot-assisted therapy for individuals with intellectual disabilities. For instance, Marino et al. (2020) and De Korte et al. (2020) reported both difficulty in capturing behavioral nuances and limited depth of assessment when evaluating social-emotional understanding interventions. Studies focusing on social communication skills, such as Marzano et al. (2021) and Nanou et al. (2021), emphasized the challenges in measuring complex social interactions between participants and robotic systems.

In the context of autism-specific research, multiple studies (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Boccanfuso et al., 2016) identified limitations in accurately measuring complex social interactions and behavioral responses. Scassellati et al. (2018) and Shah et al. (2023) specifically noted difficulties in capturing subtle behavioral changes during long-term, in-home interventions. Additionally, studies involving educational applications, such as Reardon et al. (2018), reported challenges in accurately perceiving and assessing student behavior during robot-assisted learning activities.

Some researchers also identified methodological constraints related to data collection and analysis. For example, Rakhymbayeva & Sandygulova (2021) highlighted limitations in engagement assessment due to heterogeneous data, while Zanatta et al. (2023) reported challenges in measuring complex outcomes and achieving sufficient depth of assessment in their systematic review of robot-assisted therapy combined with virtual reality.

These assessment limitations underscore the complexity of evaluating robot-assisted interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities and suggest the need for more sophisticated assessment tools and methodologies in future research.
