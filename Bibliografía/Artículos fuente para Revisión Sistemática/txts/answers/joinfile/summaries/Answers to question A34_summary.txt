There were 59 papers that incorporated communication feedback systems such as voice recognition and speech synthesis, while 37 papers did not include these features. This represents approximately 61% of the analyzed studies utilizing some form of audio communication technology.

The implementation of communication feedback systems was predominantly achieved through speech synthesis capabilities, which were integrated into various robotic platforms. The NAO robot was frequently mentioned across multiple studies (Charron et al., 2017; Conti et al., 2020; Papadopoulou et al., 2022; Pennington et al., 2014) as it comes equipped with built-in speech synthesis and voice recognition capabilities. Other robots, such as MARIA (Valadao et al., 2016), Teo (Bonarini et al., 2016), and QTrobot (Tartarisco et al., 2022), also incorporated audio communication systems.

The communication feedback systems served various purposes in these studies. Some robots used speech synthesis to provide instructions or verbal feedback during therapeutic interventions (Bugnariu et al., 2013; Marino et al., 2020). Others employed audio capabilities for emotional expression through sound effects (Boccanfuso et al., 2016) or to facilitate language development (She & Ren, 2021). Several studies implemented more complex communication systems that combined both speech synthesis and voice recognition capabilities (Lee et al., 2013; Papadopoulou et al., 2022) to enable bidirectional communication between the robot and the user.

Some researchers opted for alternative approaches to voice communication, such as using pre-recorded human voice files (Park & Kwon, 2016) or incorporating MP3 modules for sound playback (Yin & Tung, 2013). These variations in implementation demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of communication feedback systems in meeting different therapeutic and educational objectives for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
