There were 46 papers that reported communication improvements in their results, while 50 papers did not report such improvements. The reported communication enhancements encompassed various aspects of verbal and non-verbal communication skills.

A significant number of studies documented improvements in verbal communication effectiveness. For instance, Valadao et al. (2016) and Bharatharaj et al. (2017) reported enhanced verbal communication abilities in children with ASD following robot-assisted interventions. Several studies, including Giannopulu (2013) and Hong et al. (2022), observed specific improvements in expressive language use and phonetic convergence. Notably, Hong et al. (2022) documented improvements in both vowel formants and speech rate for children with and without ASD.

Non-verbal communication improvements were also frequently reported. Tobar et al. (2021) and Sakka & Gaboriau (2017) observed enhanced non-verbal communication skills and more organized interactions. Studies like Miskam et al. (2013) and Shimaya et al. (2019) noted improvements in two-way communication and longer conversation durations when participants interacted with robots compared to direct human interactions.

Several researchers documented improvements in specific communication domains. Pennington et al. (2014) reported enhanced ability to compose text messages with targeted components, while Papadopoulou et al. (2022) observed improvements in reading speed, word production, and written expression. Silvera-Tawil et al. (2018) noted advancements in articulation, verbal participation, and spontaneous conversation initiation.

The communication improvements were often accompanied by other social-emotional gains. Lemaignan et al. (2022) reported that some students used robots to express feelings they wouldn't normally share, while Scassellati et al. (2018) received positive caregiver reports regarding improved communication effectiveness. These findings suggest that robot-assisted interventions can facilitate both quantitative and qualitative improvements in communication skills for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
