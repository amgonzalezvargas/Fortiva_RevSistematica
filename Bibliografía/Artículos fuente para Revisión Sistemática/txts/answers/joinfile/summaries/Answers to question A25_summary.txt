There were 11 papers out of 97 total papers (11.3%) that reported using custom developed non-robotic hardware in their studies. The custom hardware implementations varied significantly across the studies, ranging from specialized interfaces to complete intervention systems.

Several studies focused on developing custom hardware for specific therapeutic purposes. Lee et al. (2013) implemented a specialized robot server and client system specifically designed for eye contact training. Similarly, Lee et al. (2014) created a custom interface called "Touch Ball," which incorporated a transparent half sphere connected to a base plate through a three-component force sensor to provide touch and color feedback. Tobar et al. (2021) developed a portable robotic modular kit specifically designed for teaching gestures to children with autism spectrum disorder.

Some researchers created comprehensive intervention systems with custom hardware components. Scassellati (2018) developed custom computer subsystems for in-home interventions, while Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018) designed a hybrid system incorporating custom hardware components for multi-sensory stimulation rooms, including specialized equipment like pianos with lights and pictogram panels. Subramani et al. (2017) constructed a custom workstation with a specialized robotic end effector for motor skills assessment.

Other studies focused on enhancing existing robotic platforms with custom hardware additions. Alnajjar et al. (2021) developed a custom chest mount to attach a mobile phone display to a NAO robot, while Hossain et al. (2020) integrated ultrasonic sensors and other custom hardware components into their system. Brivio et al. (2021) created custom hardware systems to support their soft, mobile autonomous robot design.

Some researchers developed specialized systems for specific therapeutic goals. Nie et al. (2018) implemented a custom robot-mediated system specifically for joint attention training. Santos et al. (2023), in their scoping review, identified multiple studies that utilized custom developed hardware systems, highlighting the diversity of hardware solutions being developed in this field.
