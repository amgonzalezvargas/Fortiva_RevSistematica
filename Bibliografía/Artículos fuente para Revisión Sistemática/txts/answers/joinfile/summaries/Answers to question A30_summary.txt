There were 18 papers out of 97 that reported using physical sensors in their studies, representing approximately 18.6% of the total analyzed papers. The physical sensors implemented across these studies can be categorized into several main types: tactile/touch sensors, motion sensors, physiological sensors, and other specialized sensors.

Tactile and touch sensors were the most commonly implemented, appearing in multiple studies. For instance, Bharatharaj et al. (2018), Bonarini et al. (2016), Costa et al. (2013), and Sandygulova et al. (2019) incorporated touch sensors in their robotic platforms to detect physical interactions. Some studies used force sensors specifically, such as Lee et al. (2014) who implemented a three-component force sensor to measure applied forces in their Touch Ball interface.

Motion-related sensors were also frequently utilized, including accelerometers and gyroscopes. Boccanfuso et al. (2016) equipped their robot with both an accelerometer and gyroscope to measure movement, while Brivio et al. (2021) implemented accelerometers alongside capacitive touch sensors in their mobile robot design.

Several studies incorporated physiological sensors for monitoring participant responses. Tartarisco et al. (2022) utilized heart rate variability monitoring through chest belts, while Welch et al. (2023) employed the E4 wristband to measure electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and blood volume pulse. Kim et al. (2021) specifically used EMG sensors to detect facial muscle activity related to smiling.

Other specialized sensors included ultrasonic sensors (Bharatharaj et al., 2018; Pistoia et al., 2017), infrared sensors (Soleiman et al., 2014), and microphones for sound recording (Peng et al., 2018; She & Ren, 2021). Some studies, such as Subramani et al. (2017), implemented more complex sensor systems including force-torque sensors and motion capture markers for detailed movement analysis.

This diverse implementation of physical sensors demonstrates their importance in creating interactive and responsive robotic systems for individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly in applications focused on social interaction, movement analysis, and physiological response monitoring.
