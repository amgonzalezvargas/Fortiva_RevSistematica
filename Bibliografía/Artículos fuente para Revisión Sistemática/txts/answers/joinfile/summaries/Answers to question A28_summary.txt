There were 41 papers that reported using control systems in their studies, while 55 papers did not incorporate such systems. The control systems identified in the literature can be categorized into several main types: autonomous navigation systems, mobile platforms, programmable robots, and teleoperated/remote-controlled systems.

Autonomous navigation systems were implemented in multiple studies, with robots capable of independent movement and interaction. For instance, Bharatharaj et al. (2017) developed a robot with autonomous navigation capabilities, while Bonarini et al. (2016) created Teo, a mobile robot with an autonomous navigation system. Some studies combined autonomous and remote control capabilities, such as Brivio et al. (2021), who designed a soft, mobile robot that could operate both autonomously and through remote control.

Mobile platforms were another common implementation, as demonstrated in studies like Agel et al. (2020), who utilized a mobile robot platform controlled by a Raspberry Pi, and Attawibulkul et al. (2019), who developed the BLISS robot as a two-wheeled mobile platform. Programmable robots, such as the Bee-Bot, were employed in several studies, including Chaldi & Mantzanidou (2021) and Pérez-Vazquez et al. (2022), where the robot could be programmed with basic movement commands for educational purposes.

Teleoperation and remote control systems were frequently utilized, allowing therapists or researchers to control the robots during interventions. Examples include Li et al. (2020), who developed a teacher-teleoperated robot controlled via tablet interface, and Bharatharaj et al. (2016), who implemented a Bluetooth-controlled joystick for remote operation. Some studies, such as Tartarisco et al. (2022), employed hybrid control systems where robots could be partially controlled by therapists using visual programming interfaces while maintaining some autonomous capabilities.

The implementation of these control systems demonstrates the versatility and adaptability required in robotics interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities, allowing for both structured autonomous interactions and human-guided therapeutic sessions.
