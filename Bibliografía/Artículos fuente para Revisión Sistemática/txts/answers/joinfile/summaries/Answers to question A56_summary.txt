There were 31 papers that reported outcome limitations in their studies, while 65 papers did not report any significant limitations. The reported limitations can be categorized into several key areas that highlight important considerations in the field of robotic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Individual variability in responses was frequently cited as a significant limitation across multiple studies (Brivio et al., 2021; Conti et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021; Santos et al., 2023; Welch et al., 2023). This variability necessitated the individualization of interventions and posed challenges in developing standardized protocols. The heterogeneous nature of participant responses complicated the generalization of findings and highlighted the need for personalized approaches in robotic interventions.

Limited skill transfer to non-robotic contexts emerged as another prevalent concern (Alnajjar et al., 2021; Boccanfuso et al., 2016; Bonarini et al., 2016; Cervera et al., n.d.). Several researchers noted difficulties in participants' ability to generalize learned skills beyond the robotic intervention setting to real-world situations. This limitation raises questions about the ecological validity of robotic interventions and their practical effectiveness in promoting lasting behavioral changes.

Uncertain long-term sustainability of improvements was consistently reported across studies (Bharatharaj et al., 2017; Charron et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2014; Scassellati et al., 2018). Many researchers acknowledged the lack of longitudinal data to support the durability of observed improvements, suggesting the need for extended follow-up periods to assess the maintenance of acquired skills and behaviors.

Limited evidence of real-world effectiveness was identified as a significant constraint (Conti et al., 2020; De Korte et al., 2020; Marino et al., 2020; Zanatta et al., 2023). This limitation often stemmed from small sample sizes, controlled laboratory settings, and the challenges of implementing robotic interventions in natural environments. The gap between laboratory findings and real-world applications underscores the importance of conducting more extensive field studies to validate the practical utility of robotic interventions.

These findings emphasize the need for future research to address these limitations through longer-term studies, larger sample sizes, and more robust assessment methods for measuring skill transfer and maintenance in natural settings. Additionally, the development of more adaptive and personalized robotic intervention protocols may help address the challenge of individual variability in responses.
