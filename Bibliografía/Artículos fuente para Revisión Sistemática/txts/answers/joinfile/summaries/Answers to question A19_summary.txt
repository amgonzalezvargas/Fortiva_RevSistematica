There were 16 papers out of 97 that incorporated executive function and cognitive activities using robots, representing approximately 16.5% of the total analyzed studies. The implementation of these activities focused primarily on developing cognitive skills through various robotic interventions and programming tasks.

Several studies utilized specialized robotic platforms for cognitive development. For instance, Pérez-Vazquez et al. (2022) employed the Bee-Bot robot specifically for enhancing executive functions, including planning, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control. Similarly, Nanou et al. (2021) implemented LEGO Mindstorms robots in educational activities designed to develop executive function and cognitive skills through programming exercises.

The cognitive interventions often integrated multiple approaches. Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018) developed a hybrid system incorporating multi-sensory stimulation rooms with robotic assistants, featuring components such as a piano with lights for memory and attention exercises. Scassellati et al. (2018) implemented long-term, in-home robotic interventions that included sequencing and ordering games to enhance cognitive abilities.

Mathematical and computational thinking were prominent focuses in several studies. Shahriar et al. (2021) developed mathematical exercise programs using the NAO robot for basic operations, while Reardon et al. (2018) incorporated mathematical calculations and geometric reasoning tasks. Programming activities were frequently utilized as cognitive development tools, as demonstrated in studies by Lindsay (2020) and Sakka & Gaboriau (2017), where participants engaged in robot programming tasks to enhance executive function skills.

Some researchers implemented game-based approaches to cognitive development. Chevalier et al. (n.d.) utilized a "Simon says" game to evaluate executive function skills, while Taheri et al. (2019) incorporated working memory games and musical instrument operation in their intervention protocol. These gamified approaches were designed to maintain engagement while developing specific cognitive abilities.

The studies collectively demonstrate the potential of robotic interventions in supporting executive function and cognitive development through structured activities, programming tasks, and interactive exercises. This integration of robotics with cognitive development activities represents an emerging approach in therapeutic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
