There were 29 papers that focused on developing or evaluating Emotional Intelligence skills, while 67 papers did not address this aspect. The analysis of these studies reveals a significant emphasis on utilizing robotic technologies to enhance various aspects of emotional intelligence in individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

The research approaches predominantly concentrated on several key areas of emotional intelligence development. A substantial number of studies focused on emotion recognition training, with researchers like Abdelmohsen & Arafa (2021), Costa et al. (2014), and Lebersfeld et al. (2018) implementing specific programs to enhance participants' ability to identify and label emotions. These interventions often utilized humanoid robots displaying various emotional expressions for recognition exercises.

Multiple studies incorporated comprehensive emotional intelligence development protocols. For instance, Marino et al. (2020) designed interventions targeting not only emotion recognition but also emotional comprehension and perspective-taking abilities. Similarly, Tartarisco et al. (2022) implemented a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol specifically focused on teaching emotional skills and vocabulary through robotic interactions.

The methodological approaches varied significantly across studies. Some researchers, such as Brivio et al. (2021) and Bonarini et al. (2016), utilized robots designed to express emotions and engage participants in emotional interactions. Others, like Silva et al. (2023) and Sakka & Gaboriau (2017), implemented storytelling-based approaches to develop emotional comprehension skills. Several studies, including Kim et al. (2021) and Zhanatkyzy et al. (2020), incorporated quantitative measurements of emotional responses and interactions.

Interactive elements were prominent in many studies, with researchers like Sandygulova et al. (2019) developing specific applications and games targeting emotion recognition. The integration of multimodal interactions was also notable, as demonstrated in studies by Giannopulu (2013) and Robles-Bykbaev et al. (2018), which combined robotic assistants with various sensory stimulation approaches to support emotional development.

These findings indicate a strong trend toward utilizing robotic technologies as tools for emotional intelligence development, particularly in therapeutic and educational contexts for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The diversity of approaches and methodologies suggests an evolving understanding of how robotic interventions can effectively support emotional skill development.
