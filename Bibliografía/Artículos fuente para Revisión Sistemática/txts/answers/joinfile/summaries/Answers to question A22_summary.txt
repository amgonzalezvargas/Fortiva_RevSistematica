There were 39 papers that reported using commercially available non-robotic hardware in their studies, while 57 papers did not mention using such equipment. The analysis reveals several categories of commonly used commercial hardware across these studies.

Vision and recording equipment was the most frequently utilized category, with Microsoft Kinect being particularly prevalent, appearing in multiple studies (Bonarini et al., 2014; Bonarini et al., 2016; Taheri et al., 2016; Taheri et al., 2019; Taheri et al., 2018; Yun et al., 2014; Yun et al., 2016). Various types of cameras were also commonly employed, including webcams (Sandygulova et al., 2019; Soleiman et al., 2014), HD cameras (Mavadati et al., 2014), and specialized cameras like the ASUS XtionPro (Lee et al., 2013).

Motion capture and tracking systems represented another significant category, with studies utilizing equipment such as PTI Phoenix Technologies Motion Capture Equipment (Subramani et al., 2017) and 12-camera motion analysis systems (Bugnariu et al., 2013). Eye tracking technology was also implemented, with the Tobii Eye Tracker T60 being used in at least one study (Casellato et al., 2017).

Physiological monitoring devices were employed in some studies, including the Empatica E4 wristband (Welch et al., 2023) and the Zephyr heart rate variability chest belt (Tartarisco et al., 2022). Mobile and display devices were also frequently utilized, including Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablets (Li et al., 2020), iPhones (Pennington et al., 2014), and Google Glass for augmented reality applications (Reardon et al., 2018).

Other specialized equipment included RPLidar 360° 2D laser scanners (Binotte et al., 2017) and various audio recording devices such as wireless microphones and Bluetooth speakers (Bharatharaj et al., 2016). This diverse range of commercial hardware demonstrates the multifaceted approach researchers are taking to study and support individuals with intellectual disabilities.
