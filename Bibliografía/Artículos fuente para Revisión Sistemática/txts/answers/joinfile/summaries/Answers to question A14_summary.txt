There were 83 papers that implemented social interaction activities with robots, while 13 papers did not include such activities. This represents a significant majority (86.5%) of studies incorporating social interaction components in their interventions.

The social interaction activities implemented across these studies can be categorized into several main approaches. Interactive scenarios were the most common format, where robots engaged with participants through structured activities such as games, conversations, and skill-building exercises. For instance, Scassellati et al. (2018) implemented social skills games between children, caregivers, and robots in home settings, while Marino et al. (2020) utilized group-based sessions with robots to enhance social-emotional understanding.

One-on-one interactions between participants and robots were also frequently employed, as demonstrated in studies like Valadao et al. (2016) and Conti et al. (2020), where humanoid robots were used to improve specific skills through direct interaction. Some researchers, such as Nanou et al. (2021), implemented collaborative scenarios where participants worked together with peers and robots on shared tasks.

Role-playing exercises and structured dialogues were incorporated in several studies, including Shimaya et al. (2016), who used indirect conversations mediated by desktop humanoid robots, and Silva et al. (2023), who implemented social stories using the humanoid robot ZECA. Group-based sessions were also utilized, as seen in Tartarisco et al. (2022), who conducted emotional skill training in small groups with robot mediation.

The social interaction activities were often designed to target specific skills, such as joint attention (Kajopoulos et al., 2015), communication skills (Silvera-Tawil et al., 2018), and emotional recognition (Costa et al., 2014). These interventions typically involved structured protocols while allowing for some degree of spontaneous interaction, as exemplified by Giannopulu (2013), who incorporated free spontaneous game play with mobile toy robots.
