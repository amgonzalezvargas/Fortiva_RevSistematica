In the analysis of storytelling and play-based activities with robots, there were 22 papers that implemented these approaches, while 74 papers did not incorporate such activities in their methodologies. The implementation of storytelling and play-based activities demonstrated significant diversity in their application and objectives.

Several studies utilized humanoid robots, particularly the NAO robot, for conducting storytelling sessions and interactive play activities. For instance, Che Hamid et al. (2013) and Miskam et al. (2013) implemented specific interactive storytelling modules using the NAO robot, with the latter focusing on emotional storytelling to enhance emotional understanding. Similarly, Marathaki et al. (2022) employed the NAO robot for both storytelling and symbolic play activities, including scenarios such as collaborative pretend cooking.

The storytelling approaches varied in their implementation and complexity. Some studies, like Silva et al. (2023) and Sandygulova et al. (2019), utilized structured social stories and folk fairy tales respectively. Scassellati et al. (2018) incorporated storytelling through a specific 'Story' game designed to enhance emotional understanding, while Sakka & Gaboriau (2017) took an innovative approach by allowing participants to create and program stories for robots to perform.

Several researchers integrated multiple modalities within their storytelling activities. Hamzah et al. (2014) combined storytelling with musical elements, incorporating nursery rhymes and associated actions for children to follow. Lemaignan et al. (2022) implemented an interactive approach where children could actively participate in story creation by choosing story elements.

The objectives of these activities were diverse, ranging from enhancing social communication skills (Silva et al., 2023) to developing symbolic play and imitation skills (Marathaki et al., 2022). Some studies, such as Brivio et al. (2021) and Bonarini et al. (2016), focused on using soft, mobile robots for more engaging and personalized play-based interactions.

These findings suggest that storytelling and play-based activities with robots represent a significant methodological approach in robot-assisted interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly in contexts focusing on social skill development and emotional understanding.
