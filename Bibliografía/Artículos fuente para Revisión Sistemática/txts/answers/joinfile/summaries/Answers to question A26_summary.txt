There were 81 papers that reported using custom developed software, while 15 papers did not mention any custom software development. The vast majority of studies (84.4%) implemented some form of custom software solutions to meet their specific research needs.

The custom software development broadly fell into several main categories. The most common type was custom robot behavior control software, which was implemented in studies like Scassellati (2018), Valadao et al. (2016), and Bharatharaj et al. (2017) to program specific robot movements, responses and interactions. Many studies also developed custom interactive games and activities tailored to their therapeutic goals, as seen in Attawibulkul et al. (2019) with their daily routine game and Bonarini et al. (2014) with motion-based touchless interactions.

Another significant category was custom algorithms for various analytical purposes. For example, Welch et al. (2023) developed machine learning algorithms for processing physiological signals, while Wanglavan et al. (2019) created custom attention detection algorithms. Some studies like Bharatharaj et al. (2016) implemented custom facial recognition software, while others like Subramani et al. (2017) developed specialized assessment systems.

Several studies created comprehensive software platforms, such as Pistoia et al. (2017) who developed the OMNIACARE platform for exercise delivery and system management. Others focused on specific educational applications, like Zamin et al. (2019) who created custom software for teaching Jawi letters to children with autism.

The prevalence of custom software development across these studies highlights the need for specialized technological solutions in this field, as off-the-shelf solutions often cannot adequately address the unique requirements of therapeutic interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. This customization allows researchers to precisely control robot behaviors, implement specific therapeutic protocols, and gather detailed data about participant interactions and responses.
