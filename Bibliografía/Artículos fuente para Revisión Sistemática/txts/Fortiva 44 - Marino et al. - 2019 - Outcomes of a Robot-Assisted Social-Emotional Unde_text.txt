Fourteen children (4-8 years old) were randomly assigned to 10 sessions of a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention implemented in a group setting either with or without the assistance of a social robot. The CBT protocol was based on Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) principles. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Test of Emotional Compre- hension (TEC) and the Emotional Lexicon Test (ELT). Substantial improvements in contextualized emotion recognition, comprehension and emotional perspective-taking through the use of human-assisted social robots were attained.

Social cognitive impairment includes deficits in social awareness, perspective-taking and implicit theory of mind (Leekam 2016). Social communication gaps in those children with functional language and without intellectual disability involve lack of integration with typi- cal complementary nonverbal cues and related difficulties in metacommunication, difficulties in understanding social contexts and maintaining reciprocal conversation (Sharma et al. 2018). Overall, these innate difficulties give rise to impairments in initiating and sustaining typical peer relationships, and thus potentially contribute to the development of negative beliefs about the self, peer rejection and further social with- drawal and isolation (Berenguer et al. 2018; Jones et al. 2018). Emotional regulation is a key developmental capacity. Effective emotional regulation is associated with social suc- cess, academic readiness, and prosocial behaviours, while emotional dysregulation predicts increases in social and behavioural difficulties over time (Berkovits et al. 2017). Children on the autism spectrum have documented emo- tional regulatory challenges, especially children previously described through the diagnostic label “Asperger syndrome” (De Giambattista et al. 2018) and, more generally, children with mild language and motor delays but without cognitive disability (Rubenstein et al. 2018). Some of these difficulties are associated with neurological differences and cognitive learning style differences, which are associated with an ASD diagnosis. Other challenges may be associated with ASD-related social learning differences, which impact the nature and effectiveness of social interac- tions that are geared towards expanding a child’s emotional “tool-box”’. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorders Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach routinely used in clinical settings to treat a wide ' In this paper, we have chosen to use the expression “on the autism spectrum” to describe children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder according to DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013). This expression is widely accepted by professionals and stake- holders (Kenny et al. 2016) and avoids the person-first (person with autism or ASD) versus identity-first debate (autistic or ASD person). The children involved in our study are too young to choose for them- selves how to self-identify and we do not feel comfortable choosing for them. Unless otherwise specified, in the following we will focus on individuals without intellectual disability, with functional lan- guage and with a DSM-5 symptom severity level of 1 or 2 on both DSM-5 domains. D) Springer Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 range of mental health disorders, including anxiety in chil- dren and young people on the autism spectrum (NICE 2013). CBT interventions are short-term, goal-oriented approaches, which aim to support individuals to recognize the interrela- tion between their thoughts, behaviours and emotions and to develop new ways of thinking about, and coping with, stress- ful situations (Beck 2011). Increasing evidence supports the use of CBT protocols for individuals on the autism spectrum who have functional language communication abilities. Rational Emotional Behaviour Therapy (REBT), is a form of CBT aimed to improve multiple skills related to the three dimensions of Emotion Comprehension (EC) described in the developmental model proposed by Pons et al. (2004). The model comprises nine components grouped into three main dimensions, namely, comprehension of the nature of emotions (recognition of basic emotions and appreciation of mixed emotions), the causes of emotion (the role of external causes, desires, beliefs, memory and moral values) and the fact that emotions may be regulated (the awareness that there may be a difference between the emotion experienced and that displayed and that it is possible to regulate the intensity of current emotional experience). CBT interventions have been adapted to improve core aspects of ASD, such as social-behavioural adaptations and social skills (Hesselmark et al. 2014; Laugeson et al. 2012), as well as co-occurring emotional and behavioural symp- toms, such as low mood and low self-esteem, social anxi- ety, emotional regulation and aggression, etc. (Lopata et al. 2006; Reaven et al. 2012; Santomauro et al. 2016; Scarpa and Reyes 2011; Sofronoff et al. 2005, 2007). Overall, systematic reviews have demonstrated that CBT interventions show promising evidence of efficacy and are a viable intervention for individuals on the autism spectrum, although the variability of the study designs, the heterogene- ity of the participants’ clinical presentation and the meth- odological limitations reduce the generalizability of study findings (Danial and Wood 2013; Weston et al. 2016; Spain et al. 2015, 2017; Lang et al. 2010; Kreslins et al. 2015; Sukhodolsky et al. 2013). CBT protocols in children and adults on the autism spec- trum have been delivered individually, with the involve- ment of family members or in a group-based format. While individual CBT protocols ensure a better personalization of the therapy objectives and strategies to the specific needs and skills of the single subject (White et al. 2009), group- based CBT interventions take advantage of the influence of social interaction, promoting experience-sharing, improv- ing self-acceptance and supporting insights of both personal strengths and impairments (Hesselmark et al. 2014). Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 Social Robots for Autism Spectrum Disorders In the last two decades, an emerging field of study has been the integration of classical cognitive and behavioural therapies with new technologies. Recently, Grynszpan et al. (2014) reported a meta-analysis of technology-based inter- vention studies that used a pre—post design for children on the autism spectrum, including computer programs, virtual reality, and robotics. The overall mean effect size approached the medium magnitude (d= 0.47) and the results provided support for the continuing development, evalua- tion, and clinical usage of technology-based intervention. Nevertheless, their findings demonstrated large differences in the level of research design; in particular, all the robotics studies had to be excluded due to either the type of research design or the number of participants. In spite of its limited clinical validation (Ismail et al. 2018; Scassellati et al. 2012), Robot-assisted autism therapy (RAT) has gained traction in the past few years to become an emerging and promising application area in autism and researchers and clinicians have developed robotic models with a wide range of appearances, features and functional capabilities that draw from expertise in fields such as engi- neering and clinical psychology (Sartorato et al. 2017). Robot-mediated intervention studies have demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy in different social com- munication domains such as joint attention, imitation, turn- taking, communicative behaviours (Pennisi et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2013) and in teaching as an emulated peer (Saadatzi et al. 2018). A central issue for the still limited clinical validation of RAT is the very small and heterogeneous clinical samples analysed by most of the studies in the field based on explor- atory or single-case designs. To our knowledge, only one RCT study (Yun et al. 2017) and one feasibility study (Men- goni et al. 2017) have been conducted. The RCT focused on young children on the autism spectrum and used a robot- mediated, discrete trial teaching protocol to improve basic social skills such as eye contact and facial emotion recogni- tion, while the feasibility study aimed to test the effective- ness of a humanoid robot to support social skills in young children on the autism spectrum. Nevertheless, no RCTs have been conducted for a robot- assisted intervention embedded into a group-based CBT for young children on the autism spectrum and, more generally, no RCTs with social robots have aimed at the development of higher-order emotional behaviour and cognition, such as emotional perspective-taking. Objectives and Hypotheses To begin filling in the gap in RAT for the autism spectrum, we aim to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of using a 1975 partially controlled social robot (NAO) in the context of a group-based CBT protocol focused on emotion comprehen- sion and related mentalizing skills, knowledge of a basic emotional lexicon and the ability to attribute appropriate emotions in relation to the context. Central to our study, the robot exerts a pivotal role as co-therapist by taking turns, directing attention, delivering cues and prompting and reinforcing adequate responses and behaviours in a natural, interactive way. We hypothesize that children on the autism spectrum randomly assigned to the robot-mediated intervention will show (1) an increase in their emotional competence after the intervention and (2) higher improvements in their socio- emotional understanding skills compared to children on the autism spectrum who will undergo the intervention without the social robot assistance. Methods Inclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) between 4 and 8 years of age; (2) clinical diagnosis of ASD based on the DSM.-5 criteria from a licensed clinical child neuropsychia- trist; (3) DSM-5 severity scores from mild (level 1) to mod- erate (level 2) in both social communication and Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behaviours domains; (4) a verbal and performance Developmental Quotient above 70; (5) no current problems with aggressive behaviour or severe oppo- sitional tendency; (6) no hearing, visual, or physical disabili- ties that would prevent participation in the intervention; (7) not being on psychiatric medication; and (8) not receiving any other intervention directly related to emotional and/or social skills during the trial. All participants have a previous diagnosis that was fur- ther confirmed through the assessment and the consensus of experienced professionals on the research team (1.e., a child neuropsychiatrist and a clinical psychologist). Participants Children were recruited as part of an ongoing research pro- gramme and tested at our clinical facilities. We enrolled N=58 children on the autism spectrum, aged 4 to 8 years, in our research programme. A first screening based on global and verbal DQ (developmental quotient) was implemented and n= 22 children were eligible and were further assessed; n= 14 (12 M:2 F) fully met the entry criteria and were enrolled in the present study; n=3 children were excluded because they were already receiving interventions directly related to social-communication skills; n=4 children were excluded because they were on medications; and n= 1 child D) Springer 1976 Fig. 1 Subject recruitment, assignment, and assessment procedures Enrolment Eligibility Allocation Follow-Up Analysis Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the sample Variable Unit Robot group (n=7) Mean SD Mdn Full Range Age (months) 73.3 16.1 7.0 48.0-96.0 Other therapies (hours) 2.60 50 3.00 2.00—3.00 Formal schooling* (years) 2.14 99 2.00 .Q00—3.00 Weekly schooling* — (hours) 27.0 .O 27.0 27.0—27.0 Special ed. teacher (hours) 1.6 29 1.0 1.0-12.0 Parents education** (years) 15.1 2.5 13.0 13.0—-18.0 Allocated to Robot Group (n=7) - Received allocated intervention - Discontinued intervention (n=0) Analysed (n=7) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 Approached (n=36) -Declined to participate (n= 0) Excluded (n=22) Included (n=14) - Not meeting inclusion criteria (n=22 - Randomized (n=14) 6 (n=22) - Not finished initial assessment ( 0) Allocated to Control Group (n=7) - Received allocated intervention (n=7) (n=7) - Lost to follow-up (n=0) - Discontinued intervention (n=0) Analysed (n=7) - Excluded from analysis (n=0) Comparison between Groups - Lost to follow-up (n=0) - Excluded from analysis (n=0) Mean SD # £Mdn_ FullRange U Ww Z p-value 82.1 124 83.0 640-960 19.00 47.00 —-—.714 .535 2.60 50 3.00 2.00-3.00 24.55 52.5 .000 1.00 2.14 83 2.00 1.00-3.00 25.5 53.5 .136 902 27.0 0 27.0 27.0-27.0 24.5 52.5 .000 1.00 1.6 9 1.0 1.0-12.0 245 52.5 .000 1.00 14.9 2.2 13.0 13.0-18.0 260 54.0 .218 902 *The youngest subject (Robot Group) has 48 months, he is in kindergarten for 27 h/week but we counted it as zero in formal schooling variable * SES was not available for privacy reason, we used parents formal education years as a proxy for SES was excluded because he did not complete the assessment due to the presence of aggressive behaviours (Fig. 1). A randomized block design was used to ensure that inter- vention groups were balanced with respect to gender. N=7 children (6 M:1 F; mean age in months = 73.3; SD=16.1) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (RG), 1.e., a robot-assisted intervention, while n =7 children (6 M:1 F; mean age in months = 82.1; SD = 12.4) were randomly allo- cated to the control group (CG), applying exactly the same protocol without the use of the assistive-robot. All included children were attending mainstream public schools for 27 h a week with a special teacher for 10-12 h. Furthermore, they received between 2 and 3 h of interven- tion outside our facility consisting of a mix of speech and language therapy (n=6 children), occupational therapy (n= 10 children) and behavioural intervention (n=3 chil- dren). None of the interventions were related to emotional competence or perspective-taking. All parents had a high school or college degree, 15 parents were employees, 5 were freelance professionals and 8 were stay-at-home for their children. All children were Italian (Table 1). D) Springer All children scored at or above the clinical cut-off on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), module three and scored above the clinical cut- off for developmental delay on the Griffiths Mental Devel- opment Scales, Extended Revised: 2 to 8 years (GMDS-ER 2-8). Child psychologists collected information from par- ents concerning developmental milestones (including joint attention, social interaction, pretend play and repetitive behaviours, with onset prior to 3 years of age) and current behaviours (Table 2). The complete clinical information for each participant is reported in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1). Ethics The study was conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations for human subjects, and the study design was approved by a National Research Ethics and Bio- ethics Committee. All the parents of the children who took part in the study signed a written consent form.

HomeLab is a simulation of a studio flat environ- ment, specifically designed and equipped to enable group- based interaction. The intervention setting included (a) a humanoid robot, NAO, which acted as co-therapist, provid- ing emotional and communication prompts and reinforce- ments with partial autonomous control, (b) three cameras integrated in a processing module capable of providing real- time behaviour inference data and (c) a widescreen LED TV. The HomeLab setting is pictured in Fig. 2. The humanoid robot NAO is a commercially available (SoftBank Robotics) child-sized, plastic-bodied humanoid robot (58 cm tall, 4.3 kg) equipped with 25 degrees of free- dom (DOP), tactile and audio sensors, and a wide variety of actuators (e.g., direct current (DC) servo motors and LED displays). Group Intervention Protocol We designed a group-based cognitive behavioural (CBT) emotional understanding skills training protocol based on the principles of REBT. The protocol was specifically designed to be implemented with the assistance of a social robot actively interacting with the children and providing verbal antecedents, prompts and reinforcing consequences according to an Antecedent-Behaviour-Consequence (ABC) model. The protocol was developed to improve multiple skills related to the three dimensions of Emotion Compre- hension (EC) described in the developmental model pro- posed by Pons et al. (2004). The intervention was delivered in small groups (two groups of 4 children and two groups of 3 children in the RG and CG respectively) and administered by a chartered clini- cal psychologist and CBT psychotherapist. Clinicians’ time was equally allocated between the two groups. The protocol consisted of 12 sessions (2 for the assess- ment and 10 for the therapy). Each therapy session lasted 90 min and was administered twice a week, divided into four phases applied through group games and activities. The first phase consisted of activities focused on emotion recognition skills. The second phase addressed the teaching of context-emotion association. The third phase was centred on discrimination between thoughts and emotions. Lastly, the fourth phase aimed to provide basic strategies for and insights into how to produce and use a repertoire of useful thoughts. The emotion recognition activities were centred Fig. 2 Collage of the Home Lab setting, NAO robot and an interven- tion session with the Robot Group g) Springer 1978 Table 3.

The emotion and context association tasks are centred on the game of “How I feel when ...?”, 1.e., the presentation of social situations targeted to teach how to attribute the proper emotion associated with the presented situation. The activities related to the emotions to thought recognition were centred on an “I think-I feel” game, 1.e., activities aimed at differentiating thoughts from emotions and acquiring the competence to link a thought to an emotion. Lastly, the task dedicated to the learning of a repertoire of useful thoughts was based on activities focused on the acquisition of useful thoughts related to certain emo- tional situations. In each session, the therapist explained the intended game, asking the participants to repeat the rules in order to memorize them. A summary of the protocol is reported in Table 3. Robot Supervision and Autonomous Responses For this study, we selected NAO for its wide range of vocali- zation and ease of personalization, sensors and appearance. A new rule-based supervisory controller was designed within NAO with the capacity to provide emotional and social prompts in the form of body movements and recorded verbal scripts, head and gross-motor orientation of gaze shifts as well as coordinated arm and hand points. Prompts were activated based on real-time data provided back to the robot through a dedicated application running on an iPad driven by the therapist as part of the interaction paradigm. During each session, the therapist was able to control the robot’s behaviours by means of a dedicated application for tablets developed by one of the authors. This application allowed the therapist to choose in advance the list of robot behaviours to be used during the session. In the function of the observed children’s responses, the therapist was able D) Springer to change the robot behaviours in terms of movements and speech in real-time. The therapist was also able to select one of the pre-set response modes for robot reward, encour- agement or pause, and perform an action among selected ones in order to stimulate the attention and motivation of the children and to convey positive reinforcements. The robot software was designed to recognize children’s faces and eyes, and an automatic routine enabled the robot to maintain eye contact with the children, equally distribut- ing the robot’s attention to each child. Moreover, follow- ing a specific request from a child, the therapist conveyed “prompts” through the robot, which were driven directly by the therapist. To gradually reduce the conveyed-by-the- robot prompts, a fading technique was implemented, 1.e., the prompts were gradually reduced according to the cog- nitive-behavioural approach. In the RG, such prompts are expressed in the form of “wildcards” proposed by the robot. The child was asked to use the wildcard if he/she had diffi- culties in providing the answer requested by NAO. Thus, the robot provided the first “prompt”. If no one in the group pro- vided the right answer, NAO said “try again’, allowing more time to reflect. If a child guessed the right answer within 1 min, NAO conveyed positive feedback (giggles, dancing, applause, etc). If no child provided the correct answer, NAO provided an additional prompt (a “from less to more” prompt hierarchy was adopted). If someone gave the right answer within | min, NAO provided positive feedback. If no one guessed the answer, NAO said “This was really difficult. I guess itis...” or alternatively, “I did not even know this...” or “Okay, I would say...” and conveyed the correct answer. For the CG the group, a social skills training programme was conducted using the exact same procedure, with the excep- tion that the role of the robot was replaced by the therapist. In the CG, the therapist took the role of NAO in all the “wildcard” functions and used exactly the same prompts as Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 Table 4 Pre-intervention outcome measures Mean SD Mdn Fullrange Mean TEC _ Extrernal 2.29 100 2 1-3 2.29 Mentalizing 1.43 495 1 1-2 1.14 Reflexive 857 833 1 0-2 1.00 Total 4.57 1.18 5 3-6 4.14 ELT Total 4.71 70 5 4-6 4.71 1979 Control group (n=7) Comparison between groups SD Mdn _ Full range U Ww Z p-value A52 2 2-3 25.5 53.5 145 902 .990 1 0-3 3.50 58.5 830 406 535 1 0-2 21.5 49.5 — .417 710 146 4 2-6 28.5 56.5 526 .620 A5 5 4—5 23.55 51.5 — .145 902 TEC Test of Emotional Comprehension, ELT Emotional Lexicon Test, Mdn Median, U Mann—Whitney U, W Wilcoxon W, SD standard devia- tion well as the fading strategies used by the robot in the RG.

Training and Intervention Fidelity The therapist who delivered the intervention to both groups was a chartered CBT psychotherapist, well-experienced in working with children on the autism spectrum. She had par- ticipated in the protocol development from the beginning and teamed with the engineer to implement the intervention protocol using the robot interface. Specifically, four one-hour training sessions with the robot engineer were dedicated to the final testing and inde- pendent mastery of the tablet-to-robot interface by the therapist. Adherence to the intervention protocol was assessed using the Cognitive Therapy Scale—Revised (CTS-R) (Blackburn et al. 2001) scoring system (10 scales, each ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 6). Two external coders, both chartered CBT psychotherapists, rated 50% of the ses- sions, randomly assigned in both the groups, from video footage. Therapists’ scores on individual items of the CTS-R were all above the score of 4 (Competent/Proficient) in every video scored (total scores, M=49.6, SD =4.7). Inter-rater reliability was adequate, W=.891, p=.005. Measures Outcome Measures The outcome measures for all of the RG and CG partici- pants were assessed during the weeks before and after the therapy sessions (week | and week 12, respectively). The general measures were assessed by direct observations of the children according to the ADOS-2 (Lord et al. 2012) and to the GMDS-ER 2-8 (Luiz et al. 2006). Primary out- come measures were the Test of Emotional Comprehension (TEC) (Pons and Harris 2000) and the Emotional Lexicon Test (ELT) (Grazzani et al. 2009). Both the TEC and the ELT are objective measures of a child’s performance related to Emotion Comprehension (EC) and Expression in specific social contexts. The investigators who assessed the outcome measures were blinded to intervention allocation. There were no significant differences between groups’ pre-intervention outcome measures (Table 4). The complete pre- and post intervention results for each participant are reported in the Supplementary Materials (Tables S2 to S5). Test of Emotional Comprehension (TEC) The TEC was standardized by (Pons and Harris 2000) and is considered suitable for testing children on the autism spec- trum with a range of ages and abilities, and a useful tool for research (Salomone et al. 2018). According to TEC’s theo- retical and empirical model (tested with Multidimensional Analysis), it assesses emotional understanding through 9 components that can be grouped into three factors: external (recognition, external causes and belief), mentalist (desire, reminder and hiding) and reflexive (regulation, mixed and morality). For the purpose of this study, we used these three factors as secondary measures. Emotional understanding is a key aspect of socioemo- tional competence (Denham et al. 2003, 2010), and includes emotion expression and emotional regulation (Grazzani et al. 2015). ELT was used to evaluate both the basic emotion lexicon repertory and the ability to associate emotions to a specific context. We administered the standardized Italian version (Alba- nese and Molina 2008). This test evaluates the comprehen- sion of the nature, causes and regulation of emotion in 3- to 11-year-old children. The test comprises 23 illustrated cards, as some of the nine components under study are assessed using more than one card. The adult reads a short story and shows the child four illustrated faces representing differ- ent emotional states—anger, fear, sadness, happiness, or a “neutral” expression — and asks them to select the one that corresponds to the story. For each response assessing one of the nine components, a score of | is assigned for a correct D) Springer 1980 answer and a score of 0 for a wrong answer; therefore, the total score ranged from 0 to 9. Emotional Lexicon Test (ELT) The ELT was developed to measure the development of emotional lexicon and comprehension in typical children (Gavazzi et al. 2011; Grazzani et al. 2015). Studies in the ASD population have never before been published and this is the first study to our knowledge that uses this measure in children in the autism spectrum. It was included in the research design to assess the pre- and post-intervention dif- ferences between the RG and CGs in terms of their linguistic knowledge of the basic emotion lexicon and their ability to match adequate emotions with the context. The measure consists of a series of brief scripted and illustrated scenarios, in each of which an event leads a story character to have an emotional experience. After the story has been read to the child, he or she is invited to choose which of two emotional terms more appropriately defines the protagonist’s emotional state and to give a reason for that choice. Given the age of the participants in the present study, only the first part of the test, dedicated to basic emotions, was administered, comprising seven scenarios designed to evaluate the abil- ity to name basic emotions (1.e., fear, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and shame). The total score awarded to each child thus ranged from 0 to 7. Statistical Analyses Considering the small sample size, non-parametric statistics (Mann-Whitney U-tests and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were applied in order to analyse the effects of group and intervention. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Kendall’s Con- cordance Coefficient (W) for ordinal values. Total TEC and the ELT scores were used as outcome measures. We used a one-sided test because our hypotheses were directional. We adjusted the alpha level using a Sidak correction for multiple comparison, alpha= .025 for the pri- mary measures, total TEC and ELT scores, alpha=.017 for the three ELT factors, alpha= .006 for the nine ELT scales. A Statistical power analysis was performed for sam- ple size estimation. The analysis was based on clinical judgement due to the absence of similar studies in the literature. To estimate the variables to compute the power, we considered that (1) the different components of the outcome measures are binary (pass/fail); (2) interven- tions designed to train competences usually aim at a 90% mastery criterion to ensure higher levels of maintenance (Fuller and Fienup 2018); (3) the intervention protocol specifically aims at the different EC components; and (4) usually children on the autism spectrum are similar to the D) Springer Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 sample (Salomone et al. 2018) lack 1 to 4 (Mdn=2) of the TEC components targeted by the designed interven- tion, and our clinical experience suggests that our sample should lack | to 2 (Mdn= 2) of the targeted ELT emotions. Therefore, we should expect an average increase of 1.8 points in the total scores (1.e., each participant will gain 1—3 components for each test). From the standardization of the measures, and given the strong homogeneity of the sample, we expected a standard deviation of 1 for the total scores. Therefore, with alpha=.025 and power =0.8, the projected sample size needed with this effect size (GPower 3.1) is approximately N=12 for this simplest pre- and post-intervention comparison. Thus, our proposed sam- ple size of 14 should be adequate for the main objective of this study. Our sample was underpowered for parametric tests. Nevertheless, we still wanted to have indicative parametric reference values for future replications. A power analysis for multivariate analysis (MANOVA) and within-subject effect of intervention using repeated measures ANOVA shows that with 7 participants in each group we can iden- tify only very large effects (f=0.7). Therefore, to increase the confidence in the results, we also computed 95% bias- corrected confidence intervals for our data using Boot- strap (n= 1000) with BCa (Bias Corrected Accelerated) and group stratification. The raw data for each participant comprising demo- graphic and assessment (Table S1), TEC (Table S2) and ELT (Table S3) pre-intervention and post-intervention (Tables S4 and S5 respectively) scores, are provided in the Supplementary Materials in order to give an analytical pic- ture of the sample distribution and to allow replicability. We reported parametric tests as supplementary analy- ses. We performed the following: (1) repeated measure ANOVA for intervention gains in both groups using time as a level; (2) MANOVA for between-group comparisons in intervention gains; (3) MANOVA to control for any group effects of the within-group factors on post-inter- vention behavioural changes, using age, ADOS-2 total, GMDS-ER DQ score, TEC and ELT pre-intervention scores as covariates and post-intervention gains on TEC and ELT as dependent variables (Tables S6 to S8); (4) MANOVA using the different GMDS-ER scales as covari- ates (Tables S9 and S10); and (5) comparison of pre- and post-intervention passing rates between groups in single TEC (Tables S11 and $12 respectively) and ELT (Tables S13 and S14 respectively) items using a Chi-Squared Test and computing p with 1-sided Fisher’s Exact Method. All of the abovementioned tables are reported in Sup- plementary Materials. SPSS software (v. 23, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to run statistical analyses.

D) Springer Likewise, the post-intervention total scores on ELT increased by 48% in the RG and by 12% in the CG (Fig. 5). The Mann—Whitney test indicated a significant improvement in the RG, U=49.0, W=77.0, Z=3.38, p=.001, but not in the CG, U=36.5, W=64.5, Z=1.92, p= .064 (Table 5). All children in the RG improved (Fig. 6). Comparing the RG and the CG on intervention gains, a main effect of group was found for both the TEC total score, U=43.0, W=71.0, Z=2.62, p=.009, and the ELT total score, U=47.0, W=75.0, Z=2.98, p=.001, with the RG showing a significantly higher degree of improvement compared to the CG (Tables 5, 6). Ancillary Analysis Via the repeated measures ANOVA, we found a signifi- cant main effect of time for TEC, F(1,12)=37.5, p<.001, 1? =.758, and a significant time x group interaction, F1,12)=10.1, p=.008, 17 = .458 with a difference in gain between RG and CG of 1.86 points, 95% CI [.586, 3.12].

In the multivariate model there was only a marginal negative effect of baseline ELT, F(2,6)=5.51, p=.044, Np = 647. Univariate results show a significant effect only for post-intervention ELT F(1,7)=8.88, p=.021, n° =.559. Nevertheless, bootstrap estimation of the 95% CI [—.149, .024] contains a zero.

Furthermore, bootstrap esti- mation of the 95% CI [— .598, .663] contains a zero. Analysing the effect of intervention on TEC items, we found no significant change for any specific item (Tables S11 and $12 in the Supplementary Materials). Nevertheless, the mentalizing scales show a significant improvement in the RG, U=42.5, W=7.50, Z=2.44, p=.009, increasing by 1.14 points, 95% CI [.428, 1.71]. In the RG only, there was a significant and equal gain in disgust and shame ELT items, x’ (1, N=14)=7.78, p=.010. The passing rate increased from 28.6 to 100% after the inter- vention (Table S13). G) Springer 1984 Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting results of a randomized controlled trial of a Robot-Assisted Cog- nitive Behavioural Therapy (RA-CBT) focused on emo- tional understanding and social cognition for children on the autism spectrum. The CBT protocol was based on Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) accord- ing to the developmental model proposed by Pons et al. (2004) and designed to be implemented through a super- vised social robot providing cues, prompts and reinforce- ments. The intervention consisted of 10 group-based ses- sions engaging young children in pro-social interactive play activities. We found a large effect of the social robot in boosting learning of socio-emotional understanding skills, as dem- onstrated by the significant changes reported by the RG on TEC with a mean gain of 2.71 points (+59.4%), 95% CI [1.71, 3.86], and the ELT with a mean gain of 2.29 points (+48.5%), 95% CI [1.86, 2.71] scores, as well as by the group differences in the magnitude of improvement after intervention, for TEC, 95% CI [.586, 3.12] and ELT, 95% CI [.952, 2.48]. Specifically, an increased ability to understand the beliefs, emotions and thoughts of others was found as con- firmed by significant improvement of 1.14 points (+ 80%), 95% CI [.428, 1.71], in the Mentalizing subscale of the TEC in the RG. Analysing the differences between TEC single items, we found that Recognition, External Causes and Desire showed no significant changes after intervention. An explanation for this result might be related to a ceiling effect of these outcome measures at baseline. Another explanation might be a possible moderator effect of the trial length and/or the social context should be considered, as reported by Sprung et al. (2015) in their meta-analysis. Mixed Emotion and Morality were not targeted by the intervention and showed no significant improvement trend. Belief, Regulation and Hiding showed large increases after treatment. However, we did not aim at finding significant differences in the single components; therefore, the study was likely underpowered to find them in those binary vari- ables taken alone. The Remainder showed a large increase in the RG alone and led the effect on the External factor; however, it was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Future replications with larger samples are needed to more precisely underpin the intervention effects on the single TEC subdomains. For ELT, interestingly, children in the RG showed significant improvements in performance not only in the five basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) but also for shame (Tables S13 and S14 in the D) Springer Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 Supplementary Materials). Pre-intervention measures (Table S2) showed that none of the CG children and only 2 of the RG children were able to recognize and explain shame. This is in line with previous literature reporting difficulties for children on the autism spectrum in the rec- ognition and understanding of self-conscious emotions (Heerey et al. 2003). After intervention, all of the children in the RG were able to properly recognize the emotion Shame on ELT, while none of the CG children were able to. Interestingly, shame was not explicitly taught during the protocol. We hypothesized the following two possible explanations: (1) robot therapy increased the generaliza- tion to other emotions, (2) the presence of two children in the RG who had already passed the item at baseline had led the other children to learn the emotion through inci- dental social learning. Future studies can shed light on this topic. However, we analysed the data excluding the shame item. One RG participant was excluded from the analysis because he was already at the upper limit. Interestingly, in the RG, all children reached the top score on ELT, learning from one to three new emotions (M = 1.83), while in the CG, no child reached the top score and learned up to one new emotion (M=0.571). The difference was still signifi- cant, V=38.0, W=59.0, Z=2.57, p=.014. Furthermore, following the intervention, all children in the RG, but none in the CG, reached the top scores on the ELT. We had no drop-outs during the intervention. All of the children in the RG demonstrated high interest in the robot and sustained attention and motivation throughout the inter- vention sessions. The children were exposed to the robot’s pro-social behaviours that were usually demonstrated in typical peer-to-peer interactions such as singing with them, talking to them, asking/responding to questions, initiat- ing and sharing play activities. In general, the child-robot interaction was not influenced by technology concerns, e.g., preoccupation with the robot as an object, specific sensory interest, or anxiety. The robot behaviours and the therapist training were optimized to be tuned in with the groups’ emotional and social interaction style. As reported by the parents, almost all the children in both the RG and CG spon- taneously practised the trained skills at home subsequent to the intervention. This evidence encourages further studies addressing generalization issues and long-term maintenance of robot-assisted interventions. Limitations The study has some limitations. First, we should acknowl- edge that the sample size was small, which may have accounted for the lack of significant improvement shown by the CG in our non-parametric analysis. Nevertheless, the ancillary analysis using repeated measures ANOVA and Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) 50:1973-1987 bias-corrected accelerated bootstrap suggested a small but significant effect also for the CG. However, we cannot exclude other possible explanations for the smaller effect in the CG. We designed the protocol to be administered with a robot and its specific design could be the cause of the effect. Furthermore, we cannot exclude a more general co-therapist effect. Future studies should com- pare a therapist plus robot against a therapist plus a human or pet co-therapist, and compare protocols specifically designed for Robot Assisted Therapy and protocols of already proven efficacy using only human therapists. The difference in the complexity of the tasks could be a reason for the difference between CG and RG in our study compared to the similar improvement in both groups reported by the only previous RCT using social robots by Yun et al. (2017). Qualitatively, in our study there was a difference in sustained attention between the conditions. Future studies should quantita- tively compare not only the attentional engagement but also the number of exchanges, contingency of reinforcements, consistency of the stimuli and other measures of adminis- tration reliability. It is possible that robot assistance could also increase the engagement of a human therapist already involved in the delivery of a complex, and already taxing, intervention, and our reliability measure was not able to cap- ture the difference. Furthermore, only two girls participated in our study, and although equally assigned to the different intervention condi- tions, it is not possible to infer any specific possible gender difference in the applicability and effectiveness of social robot mediated intervention. This is a very important and timely research and clinical question to bear in mind, and a specific study designed to address this topic is desirable. Future Directions Finally, a comparison of TEC and ELT scores with norma- tive data (Albanese and Molina 2008; Gavazzi et al. 2011) shows that all of the children in RG reached a normative level of emotional comprehension after the intervention, with the three youngest (48-73 months of age) well over the age norm. Salomone et al. (2018) found an age-related increase in emotional understanding skills between chil- dren on the autism spectrum and their typical peers, which reflects the challenges of increased social expectation. While increased exposure to social contexts may promote the development of emotion comprehension skills in typical development, if this is not addressed within specific psycho- educational interventions, development is not assured and exposition could be detrimental for children on the autism spectrum. In the absence of intellectual disability, those children can partially compensate for their socio-emotional impairment, but usually with a payback in low self-esteem and internalising symptoms (McCauley et al. 2017). Our 1985 study suggests that for emotional comprehension a short robot-assisted cognitive behavioural protocol of only fifteen hours may shift the children’s skills to the normative range. Future studies could address the possible protective effect of emotional skills training against the negative social feedback that many children on the autism spectrum may experience during childhood. Conclusions The results of the current study supported the idea that a partially controlled assistive robot can be used as an effec- tive augmentative mediator in CBT protocols for socio-emo- tional understanding in children on the autism spectrum. In line with our hypothesis, we found a significant positive effect of the social robot in fostering children’s learning of emotional nature, causes and regulation in relation to spe- cific social contexts. Further studies using larger samples are warranted to replicate these preliminary findings, and all the raw data gathered in this study are reported in the Supplementary Materials for future comparisons.
